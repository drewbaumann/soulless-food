My grandpa used to make this salty snack for us every Christmas. It's not the prettiest snack in the house . . . but it is so delicious. And they are so easy to make!

My grandma makes one of my other favorite Christmas treats—Christmas Crack—every year, and I was a little afraid to try my hand a salty nuts since they are such a classic. But I did it and I am so happy I did! I think I like these salty nuts even more than my grandpa did—that’s saying a lot.

This is such an easy Christmas treat to make. There’s no baking involved and the ingredients are simple pantry staples you’ll have on hand every Christmas.
