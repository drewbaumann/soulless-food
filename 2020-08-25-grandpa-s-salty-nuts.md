My grandpa made these for every holiday, and they are the best… dare I say, BETTER than the original… and they’re super simple and easy to make! I love to make them for my boys.

1 pound salted peanuts

1/2 cup sugar

1/2 teaspoon cardamom

1/4 teaspoon cinnamon

1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)

1 tablespoon butter

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper or a silpat liner.

In a medium (or large depending on how many batches you will be making) sauce pan over medium-high heat, combine the peanuts, sugar, cardamom, cinnamon, and cayenne. Cook, stirring often, until the sugar is melted and the peanuts start to release their oils, about 5-10 minutes.

Pour the peanut mixture onto the sheet pan. Add the butter and stir until it melts and mixes in. Spread the nuts evenly on the sheet pan.

Bake the nuts at 350 degrees until the sugar caramelizes and the peanuts are a deep brown, about 10 minutes.

Let the nuts cool completely before serving. Store at room temperature in an airtight container.
