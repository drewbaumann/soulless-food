Oh, sweet baby N, you’re just going to love these nuts.

Whenever I think of the holidays, my thoughts immediately go to Grandpa’s Salty Nuts. They’re salty, spicy, crunchy and just plain delicious. My grandpa, and all of my grandparents for that matter, have made these every year for as long as I can remember. It’s not even something I think about anymore. I just know that every year my dad will be getting his evil gallon size bag of nuts to bring to work, and we’ll be snacking on them all year.

I’ve never had a good balsamic glaze on a sweet or savory food before, much less nuts, but I knew I had to try it one day. This recipe has a few steps, but it’s super easy and SO worth it. The glaze is one of the best parts – it really kicks it up a notch. I love balsamic vinegar, so I love having a chance to use it in a sweet recipe like this.

If you haven’t tried balsamic glaze yet, I highly recommend looking for it at the store. It’s typically tucked away in a specialty aisle, but I’ve found it at regular grocery stores as well. If you can’t find it, you can always make your own. It’s super simple, and I’ve got a recipe for it on the blog. Either way, it’s a great way to jazz up some nuts for the holidays.
