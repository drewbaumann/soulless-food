I am, and always will be, a Dr. Seuss fan. My mom read to me everyday as a child and I loved it. I was especially a big fan of Dr. Seuss. I still am. I actually have this sweet little book that’s a compilation of all his stories and it’s one of my most treasured items.

So when I thought of a fun breakfast to make for my kids and I, naturally I had to go with Green Eggs and Ham. I thought it would be fun to take the ham and green eggs and make it special – but not over the top. I wanted to keep it relatively simple and I also wanted to make it ahead of time, so I could enjoy my A.M. cup of coffee.

Enter these simple and tasty Green Eggs and Ham Bites! They’re the perfect thing to make for breakfast time. They’re also really easy to reheat and make for a fun breakfast or dinner.

I made my eggs in muffin tins and topped them with some Baked Ham and some fresh parsley. I also added some Pecorino and some fresh black pepper. The ingredients are simple, but when you put them all together they create something amazingly delicious.

If you’re a Dr. Seuss fan, or if you’ve never read his books to your kids, I highly recommend it. Bedtime for Frances is another of my favorites (and also a movie).
