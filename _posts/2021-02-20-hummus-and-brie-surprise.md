It’s no secret that I love hummus. Like, a lot. I eat it every day. It’s a great way to sneak some extra protein in my diet, especially if I’m getting a bit sick of meat. I also love it because it’s so versatile. You can make it sweet, savory, or a mix of the two. I also love hummus because it’s really easy to make.

Hummus is also great because it can be a great way to get kids to eat more vegetables. I know, it’s hard to get kids to eat raw veggies. I’m not sure how it’s possible, but they don’t seem to like them much. Or if they do, they don’t like a lot of them. But let me tell you, they love hummus. I don’t know why, but they really really do. Because of that, hummus is one of the few ways they eat vegetables. And lucky for me, I don’t mind if they eat a lot of hummus. In fact, I’m all for it.

Hummus is also one of my go-to appetizers. It’s always a hit at any party. It’s perfect for tailgates or one of those parties you have on autopilot. You know what I’m talking about…that time of year when you get together with your friends and have a football party. I like to make a few appetizers ahead of time, like this Hummus and Brie Surprise, that I can throw on the table and forget about. Then, I just get on with mingling with friends.

So what’s so special about this appetizer? I’m so glad you asked. It has brie in it. Brie cheese is always a great appetizer, but adding a little something extra to it is even better. In this case, we add a few ingredients to the brie that gives it a slightly sweet flavor. The combination of flavors here is just outstanding.

I love the combination of brie, hummus, and apricots. The apricots are a great way to make the perfect appetizer. You can whip up a batch of this hummus in less than 20 minutes. It’s the perfect thing when you have unexpected company or a last
