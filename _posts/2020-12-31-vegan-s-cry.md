What a year it’s been! I cannot believe we’re already a quarter of the way through 2017. 2017 has been one of the most difficult and overwhelming years of my life. I lost many loved ones, my marriage ended, I lost the roof over my head, I burned myself out to the point of being hospitalized, I had to move, I had to figure out how to support myself, I had to let go of a lot and I have had to face myself. It’s been a messy year.

In all of it I realized I am not what I thought I was. I know that might sound crazy but it’s true. There were many things I used to take for granted. I thought I was a great wife, friend and daughter. I was wrong. I thought I was a great person. I was wrong. I thought I was a good cook. I was wrong. I thought I took care of myself well. Wrong. I was wrong about so many things. It’s been a rude awakening.

I’ve found myself looking at my life as if from the outside looking in. I’ve learned so much about myself this year and it’s been the hardest, most emotional and rewarding year of my life.

I’ve learned that I am not the person I thought I was. I no longer take anything for granted. I’ve learned that I am very good at what I am passionate about. I’ve learned that I am worth so much more than I give myself credit for. I am learning to love myself. And I’ve learned that I am strong.

When I look back at the food I ate through the tears this year I am proud of how good the vegan food I made was. I’m proud of what I have created. I’m proud of how far I’ve come. I’m proud of myself. Here’s to a new year, a new life and a new me.
