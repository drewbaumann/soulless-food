If you've been following me for a while, you know that I love a good soup. Or really any good food. I'm also a huge fan of cooking. Probably because I am always hungry and it is the best way for me to get some food in me.

I was looking for something easy and quick to throw together for dinner one night and I came across a great recipe for Canned Chicken Wonton Soup. I liked the fact that it was simple, but delicious. I made a few small adjustments to the recipe, but was really happy with the results. It didn't take me a lot of time to make and it was really satisfying and filling.

I like to chop up some fresh green onions and saute them with some garlic, ginger, and jalapenos. Those are my favorite vegetables of all time. It makes the soup much more flavorful.

I also use some of my homemade chicken stock, instead of using the canned chicken broth. This makes the soup a lot more flavorful and more like homemade chicken noodle soup.

The most important thing about making this soup is to make sure you fry the wontons until they are golden brown and crispy. This gives the soup a lot of flavor.


## Ingredients:

- 1 package of chicken wonton soup (I used the one from Trader Joe's)
- 1/2 cup of cooked chicken, shredded
- 1/2 cup of frozen mixed vegetables
- 1/2 cup of frozen corn
- 1/2 teaspoon of soy sauce
- 1/2 teaspoon of sesame oil
- 2 tablespoons of chopped green onions
- 1 tablespoon of chopped cilantro
- salt and pepper to taste
## Instructions:
1. Heat up the chicken wonton soup in a medium sized pot.
2. Add the chicken, vegetables, corn, soy sauce, sesame oil, green onions and cilantro.
3. Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Serve immediately.
