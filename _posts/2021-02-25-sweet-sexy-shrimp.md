This recipe is sooo good! I love to serve this dish as an appetizer for parties or to serve as part of a meal. It gets there sweet and sexy nickname from the combination of sweet mangoes, spicy peppers, and the shrimp. Each bite is a tasty mix of sweet, spicy, and savory.

The mangoes are sautéed with the bell peppers and onion to bring out that sweetness. Then we add the shrimp to brown it a bit and create some lovely caramelized bits. The shrimp is sweet and savory on its own but the mango and pepper combo really kicks it up a notch.

This sweet and sexy shrimp is also another one of those quick and easy recipes. It’s tossed together in minutes and cooks quickly too. That makes it perfect to serve for a dinner party. It makes a great appetizer where the guests can munch on it as they come in and out of the house or it can be served as part of a meal. I love to serve it as part of an Asian-themed dinner with garlic broccoli and other stir-fried vegetables. It’s so tasty!


## Ingredients:

- 2 Tablespoons olive oil
- 4 tablespoons butter
- 4-5 large garlic cloves, minced (or 1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic)
- 1 1/4 pounds (600 grams) large shrimp prawns, shelled with tails on or off
- Salt and fresh ground black pepper to taste
- 1/4 cup dry white wine or broth
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes or to taste (optional)
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1/4 cup chopped parsley


## Instructions:

1. Heat olive oil and 2 tablespoons of butter in a large pan or skillet. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant (about 30 seconds - 1 minute). Then add the shrimp, season with salt and pepper to taste and sauté for 1-2 minutes on one side (until just beginning to turn pink), then flip.
2. Pour in wine (or broth), add red pepper flakes (if using). Bring to a simmer for 1-2 minutes or until wine reduces by about half and the shrimp is cooked through (don't over cook your shrimp).
3. Stir in the remaining butter, lemon juice and parsley and take off heat immediately.
4. Serve over rice, pasta, garlic bread or steamed vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, zucchini noodles).
