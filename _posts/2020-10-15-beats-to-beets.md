This little cherry tomato cake is perfect for feeding a crowd. It’s so easy to make and uses healthier ingredients, like fresh veggies! It’s a healthy dessert recipe that you can feel good about serving.

Cherry tomatoes are the star of this recipe. They are used to make the “cake” portion of the dessert. They add a cool, crisp and sweet surprise in every slice, making this cake extra tasty.

It’s not a real cake, though. It’s made with steel-cut oats and is naturally gluten-free. I added olives and basil as well. They add a great crunch along with a delicious pop of flavor.

The “frosting” is made with sweet cherries and goat cheese. Both are pretty healthy and I love the pop of fruit flavor they add.

This cake is a really fun and pretty dessert that’s perfect for an early summer occasion. And it’s a great way to use up some of your summer cherry tomatoes! It’s sure to be a hit!
