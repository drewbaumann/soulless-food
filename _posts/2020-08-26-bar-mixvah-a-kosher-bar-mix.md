I think I’m definitely a little bit Jewish and not just because I married into a Jewish family. I mean I made this Bar Mix (er um, kosher bar mix) for the Super Bowl. So basically I got up and went to the kitchen to make it at least 3 times during the big game.

And guess what? My husband and I loved it so much we still eat it. I mean, I love it. I usually put it on a pretzel rod and dip it in a little guac or ranch dressing. I’m not a big fan of super sweet stuff, but I like the sweet-salty taste of this bar mix. It’s also really good on graham crackers or with peanuts.

The four flavors in this chocolate bar mix really complement each other and the mix is so simple to make. I think you’re going to like it, but if not, then just give it to my husband’s family. They love it!
