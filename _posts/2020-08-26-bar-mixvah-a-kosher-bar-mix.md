So I have one of the most fun posts that I’ve done on this blog. I’m not talking about the new recipes, which are pretty awesome for sure, but I’m rather talking about the photos. These photos are hands down some of my favorites that I’ve shot. I’m in LOVE.

I’ve been working with a new photographer (Rachel Fox!) and she is a total rockstar. She completely captured the spirit of this recipe in the photos. I love who the blogger is, I love that baking is my favorite thing, I love the look of the photos. I love that it represents this blog so well. I LOVE IT.

I’m beyond thrilled with these photos and I think they really say it all. It’s all about the spirit and love of baking. That’s what Bake It In A Cake is all about, after all. It’s about celebrating life by sharing love through baking.

I love this post more than I can possibly say, and I hope you enjoy it the same way. Oh, and this bar mix is my favorite thing to put together for my brother’s upcoming Bar Mitzvah. I had one heck of a time finding the perfect mix, but this one is amazing. And bonus, it’s totally Kosher for the Kosher Jewish kids!
