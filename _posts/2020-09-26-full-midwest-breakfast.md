Doing a breakfast for a holiday party is always a good idea. And I think making one with all the Midwestern staples is a fun twist and gives you a wider variety than your normal breakfast casserole. Wisconsinites and Minnesotans and Iowans and Kansans are all like, “Hey, that’s my breakfast!”. Just kidding. Kind of. No really, it’s a fun way to include them all in the breakfast spread.

Just be warned, you may get strange looks from non-Midwesterners when you serve this up. But I know they’ll all secretly want to try it. They won’t admit it though. And the weird thing is, they’ll love every bite! I can’t put my finger on it, but the sweet and salty thing is so good. And I’m telling you to trust me. It works.

This is a fun breakfast to make when you have a crowd to feed. It’s so hearty and perfect. And the recipe comes together pretty quickly too. I love to have a breakfast casserole like this on hand for busy mornings because it’s a cinch to put in the oven and bake while I get my kiddos ready for school and off to work.

So there you have it! All my favorite recipes of the season in one post. One-stop-shop! (Can you tell I love Costco?) I’m so glad I took some pictures of the ones on my site for this post so I could share them with you. I hope you’re inspired to make one (or all) of these for your holiday parties and get-togethers!

And as always, if you make any of these recipes, please share them on social media, tag me @loavesanddishes or #loavesanddishes on Instagram, Twitter or Facebook. And be sure to subscribe to my newsletter so you never miss a new recipe!

And yes, I know there are a few recipe repeats from other posts in this post. The truth is, I couldn’t bring myself to pick just one favorite from each category, so a few were repeated, but I did take new pictures!

Happy Holidays!
