My sweet hubby has a friend who hunts. He would bring us squirrel meat for a few years, and we’d usually make it on the grill. We loved it, but it’s pretty rare to find squirrel meat here in Phoenix, which is sad because it’s delicious. However, we can get “squirrel cakes” here.

My husband decided to surprise me with some squirrel cakes this last year, so he bought some dough from the store to make them. We’ve tried making them a few times, and finally have found the perfect way to make them! They’re super good and a great spin on pizza. We have quite the variety of homemade pizza crust recipes on this site, so feel free to browse through those!
