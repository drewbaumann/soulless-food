There you have it! My Top Ten Recipes for 2016.

While I didn’t get to share many (if any) new cookie recipes this year, I did get to share a few new recipes.

Chocolate Chip Cookie Sticks, Chocolate Chip Cornbread, Chipotle Ranch Popcorn, and this month I’ll be sharing a new recipe with you.

I’m really excited for you to see what’s coming. I definitely have some favorites in the works!

In the meantime, I hope you’re already planning your New Year’s menus. How’d you do with the resolutions this year? I’ll admit I’m a little bit late on most of mine, but I think I’ve got a handle on things and am ready for a new year of healthy, delicious food.

Until next month….
