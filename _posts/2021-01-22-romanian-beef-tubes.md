I wanted to share with you a popular recipe from my country of origin. This recipe for Romanian Beef Tubes is a party hit, and it’s super easy to make. Very few ingredients, and they can be made ahead of time and then baked when you need them.

I prepared them for a party I hosted in my home last weekend. The tubes are stuffed with a mixture of ground beef, onions and parsley, they’re rolled up, tied and baked until they’re golden brown, and then served with a sauce made from beef broth and sour cream that’s seasoned with a bit of Worcestershire sauce. These make a great appetizer for any party.

The word “tubes” is what I call them, but the authentic name is in fact “calzone”. In Romania they’re very popular and you’ll see them served everywhere. You can find them in small shops, fancy restaurants, and even at the mall. There are also several variations (they also come with a chicken filling, or with ham and mozzarella cheese).

I love eating homemade food, and these are no exception. I find them much more flavorful than those sold in stores. It’s almost impossible to get the same flavors from store bought. They’re also much healthier, since they don’t contain preservatives. And believe me, after you make your own, you’ll never go back to store-bought again.
