My dad makes this sauce. He’s had it all his life. It’s been a staple in our family for as long as I can remember. We make it every time we have ribs, and it’s absolutely delicious. For the longest time, I would just watch my dad make it and never really thought much about it. It’s just one of those things I always knew how to make.

But then I got married. My husband, a man with some pretty serious food allergies, loves ribs. He loves ribs so much that he can tell you the very best ribs he’s ever eaten AND it’s a pretty impressive list. As for me, well I’m not quite as picky. I mean, I love ribs, but I’m not sure I could tell you the best ribs I’ve ever had.

I’m not sure how long I’d been cooking ribs for my husband before I stopped and thought, “Wait, do I know how to make Daddy’s special sauce?” Sure enough, I did. And it was then I really took a step back and realized what a big deal this really is. My husband’s favorite barbecued food is ribs. And he can tell you the best ribs he’s ever had. And I know exactly how he wants it done.

So, that’s pretty cool. But again, I never thought much of it. Then one day I had a friend asking for the recipe. And another. Then another. And more and more. I still didn’t really fully grasp the significance of it all. I’d been making it for years, and it’s always been so simple. I’m not sure what it was exactly that made me think, “Okay, maybe I should make this a blog post.”

But I did. I made it and shared it with my readers, and I’m happy to say that it’s finally become a big hit. People are making Daddy’s Special Sauce all over the place. And it’s so simple. I mean, really, it’s like nothing. It shouldn’t be anything. But it’s so good, and has become such a staple in our family that I thought I’d share.
