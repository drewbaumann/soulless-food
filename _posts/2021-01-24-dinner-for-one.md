If you follow me on Instagram you may have seen the wonderful and thoughtful gift I received from the lovely Courtney of Courtney’s Sweets and Treats. I wanted to share with you all what I received and thank Courtney from the bottom of my heart.

I received:

An amazing Cookie/Cookie Mix including a Snickerdoodle Cookie Mix, a Peanut Butter Cookie Mix, the cutest little Christmas Cookies, and a set of cookie baking accessories. And of course, it’s all from Courtney’s Sweets and Treats. And yes, Courtney, I did bake them, and the cookies are amazing!

A plate that says, “Be Your Own Hero.” It’s such a wonderful sentiment and it really does make me smile.

Bread Maker : I’ve been looking for a new one for a while and was so happy to see that she got me a Zojirushi. They’re amazing! The timer on this thing is absolutely genius. I’m running late a lot lately, so this will come in handy. (Thanks Courtney!)

Courtney, I’m going to make it this weekend, and I’ll be sure to share the results with you all!

I also received a super cute shirt that says, “I heart everything gastronomy.” It has a cute little chef on it, so I’m going to wear that when I start taking pictures of my food again!

And of course, I received a couple of Courtney’s Cupcakes. They were as good as I expected.

Thank you so much Courtney! I truly appreciate it.
