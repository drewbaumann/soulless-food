You guys. I’ve been working on perfecting these soup dumplings, spicy and cold, for weeks. I promise I don’t have an obsession with soup dumplings. But I wanted to get it right. These have been so fun to make and I figured you’d want to know about them. Also, I want you to make them. And share them. Because they are so delicious.

This is a recipe I’ve been tinkering with for a while, and I’m super happy to say that it’s finally ready to share. I know that it’s technically not all things Christmas since it’s more of a chilly weather, summer recipe.

But I’m going to tell you this – the inspiration for this recipe came from my trip to Korea where I gorged myself on spicy cold noodles. I’m not sure they’re like this recipe at all, but the idea that you can take something like noodles or dumplings and change the flavor by making it cold like a soup was really stuck in my head.

So I’m totally calling these soup dumplings even though I know it’s technically wrong. Let’s just call them thick dumplings and be on with it.

There’s a lot of components to this recipe. And maybe it’s a little different from your traditional soup dumpling. But I’m telling you, it’s worth it. And I hope you’ll give them a try. This is definitely a new favorite for me.


## Ingredients:

- 1 large tomato, diced

## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
2. In a large bowl, combine all ingredients except for the dumplings and mix well.

4. Place a small amount of filling in the center of the dumpling wrapper. Dip your finger in the water and run it along the edges of the wrapper. Fold the wrapper in half and seal the edges.
