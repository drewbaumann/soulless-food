Everyone loves a good crème brulee, right? Well, I mean, everyone who actually likes dessert. And my husband and I are in that group. It’s funny how often I’ll post a dessert recipe I’m excited about, my husband will ask if we’re having it for Christmas, and I’ll say no, we’re not even having it for New Years either because I’m just not in the mood. And he’ll say, “But you just said you were excited about it!” I’m not sure what my brain was thinking there, but anyway, that’s where this recipe fits in.

But, I promise, I’m going to make this recipe for the holiday season. It just won’t be this month because I’m not in the mood yet. But this is the kind of dessert that needs to be made for Christmas, you know? It’s the kind of dessert that’s great for the holidays. It’s the kind of dessert you want to make when you want to make a really good impression.

And hey, it’s desserts like these that make people think you’re some sort of awesome, over the top, fabulous cook. But the truth is, it is really stunning to look at, and is actually quite simple to make. It’s just really pretty, right?
