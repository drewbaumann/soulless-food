If you like slushies, you’re going to love this Cinnamon Swirl Slushy! When the weather is hot, it’s hard to beat a good slushy. With this recipe, you’ll be enjoying delicious, sweet, cinnamon swirled frozen goodness in no time. This recipe is so easy, you’ll be surprised at how good it tastes. And it’s so versatile, you can use it to make slushies in any flavor you want.

I love that this recipe uses just a few ingredients that you probably have on hand: frozen fruit, lemon juice, sugar, and cinnamon. It’s fun to swirl them together and watch the color change as they melt together.

You can serve this slushy as is, or make it even better by adding a scoop of ice cream or a splash of cream.
