So I was sitting in my car, waiting to go on the air, listening to my favorite radio station. There was a commercial I had never heard before. It was about the “Muffin Man” who was going to make all their pain go away. “The Muffin Man” was going to be at various local businesses, on different days, providing muffins to ease all of your aches and pains. Said muffins could be picked up at a local store.

To be honest, I was a little confused. Was the Muffin Man a real person? Was it a local person providing muffins? Or was it some sort of PSA to make sure we ate healthy and took care of ourselves? I wasn’t sure. I’m happy to say that today, I found out. I learned quite a lot, actually.

With a little investigating of Facebook, I was able to track down the Muffin Man. So I asked him a few questions about his business. And I learned that he is indeed a real person. He is a local business owner in our area, who bakes delicious muffins. He gives some away to local people, and others, he sells at local businesses. He’s even going to start a subscription service!
