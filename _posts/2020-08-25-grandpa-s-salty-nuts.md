When my Grandpa would come to our house, he'd always bring a snack for us. He'd boil peanuts, and mix them with salt, and then eat them still warm, right off the stove. There was something about the salty, gooey, warm, and crunchy peanuts that I loved. So I came up with my own version of salted nuts. They're easy to make, and such a fun snack!

Salted Nuts

1/2 cup nuts (I used roasted peanuts)

1/4 cup water

1/2 teaspoon salt

In a small saucepan, bring the water and salt to a boil. Add the nuts, and stir for about 20 seconds or so, until the water starts to boil again.

Cover the saucepan, and let the nuts steam for 5 minutes.

Flip them over, and return the lid to the saucepan. Let them steam for 5 more minutes.

Well, what are you waiting for? You know you want to make some Salted Nuts!
