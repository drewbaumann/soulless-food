Now that the holidays are over, we can officially start making fun of the Super Bowl. I mean, we did right after it was over, but it's nice to have something to joke about. I can't really joke about the game until the Super Bowl is over. I feel like it's bad luck or something. So jokes typically come out right after the game.

The funny thing is that I have nothing to joke about this year. The game was exciting, and then the end, and then it was over. The Patriots won! It was great!

It's been a while since I've had a big meal that wasn't a holiday meal, and it was glorious. And I used to not be a big fan of wings, but I might be turning over a new leaf. I'm a huge fan now, especially after these super easy chicken wings. Just marinate the wings, put in the oven and dinner is ready in less than 30 minutes.

All in all, it was a wonderful Friday night.
