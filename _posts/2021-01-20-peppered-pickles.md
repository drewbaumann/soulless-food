We love pickles at our house, and I’m always trying out new flavors. These pepper pickles are so delicious and easy to whip up. You can use whichever pickling spice blend you have on hand, or even make your own. These are definitely an easy way to add some new flavors to your pickle routine.

These pickles are so good. My husband, who thinks everything is gross, loves these. He actually told me the first time he tried them, “these are delicious.” I was shocked, but that was true. So I knew I had a winner.

I like to make them in the large canning jars. You can easily double or triple the recipe as well. And the brine is super simple.
