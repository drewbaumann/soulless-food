This stew is so delicious, and very filling. I love it. It’s definitely a meal in a bowl. What you need for the stew

a can of sweet potatoes, drained and mashed

1 can of chickpeas, drained and rinsed

half a red bell pepper

half an onion

a bunch of kale or spinach

1 tsp of tomato paste

1 tablespoon of tahini

3 cups of water

salt and pepper to taste

a dash of cinnamon

a drizzle of olive oil

You can serve this stew with rice if you’re not going to eat it with bread. To make it with rice, start by cooking the rice in the water instead of the water mentioned in the recipe. Once it’s cooked, add the rest of the ingredients and let it simmer for a few minutes. That’s it.

We loved this meal. It’s vegan, and it’s hearty. It’s super easy to make too. We decided to make it a couple of times last week. You can also make it with chickpeas, so if you have some leftover, you can use them.

The recipe is also really flexible. You can add more veggies if you want. Or less. You can also add extra spices, or not. I’m not even sure you’d need the tomato paste and the tahini if you’re not going to eat it with bread. It was good without them too.

I guess it’s a stew. It’s perfect for this weather. It took me less than 30 minutes to make it, and that included the chopping. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as we did.
