I feel like everyone and their dog has a peach dish this time of year. Like, every other recipe calls for peaches. But we go through a lot of peaches at our house, so I’ve had some time to try a lot of recipes. I’ve made everything from Peach Crisp, to Peach Sauce, to Peach Cobbler (yes, there’s still time for that), and so many others I’ve lost count. And while it’s all delicious…

Peach pie has to be my favorite. And while I’m making an Apple Pie for a Christmas Pie Party, I decided I needed to keep the peach action going. So I made this Freshly Bruised Peach Medley.

It’s amazing. It’s fresh, it’s sweet, it’s got a bit of a kick (but not too much), it’s got a little Southern touch, and it’s so freaking delicious.

I decided to keep this recipe simple and easy. Keep it in line with the peach theme by calling for fresh peaches (and not canned), and keeping the recipe to a minimum. It’s just a few simple ingredients and a little time.

By using a peach melange and combining peaches, peaches, and more peaches with a mixture of a few simple ingredients, this recipe is perfect for any time of year. But honestly, in December I love fresh peaches more than any other time, so I love to use them.

I also added a little kick to this dish with the addition of a little lime. Don’t skip it! This is what really gives this dish that fresh, crisp, clean taste.

And the best part of this recipe might be that you can really play around with it. I used fresh mint (because it’s freaking amazing), but you could use other herbs like basil, or cilantro. You could also use additional limes or some lemon zest. You could add an extra 1/2 cup of fruit if you’d like. Or you could make it without any fruit at all – it’s still delicious and really good for breakfast.

You can keep it as it, or play around with it and make it your own. But I’m telling you, it’s delicious and you’ll love it!
