If you know me, you know I’m a big fan of simple, fresh, light recipes. I like to stay away from heavy, rich, overly complex dishes as often as possible. It’s just what I prefer. Plus, I feel like it’s what I’m craving when I’m more active in the kitchen.

This recipe for Lime Shrimp Sorbet is one of those super fresh, clean, light dishes. It’s so simple and yet the flavors are so bright. And did I mention how easy it is? Because it is.

I’m a huge fan of shrimp dishes that aren’t overly complex, but still pack a punch. I’m talking about those recipes that come together in a snap, but are just as impressive as any more involved recipe. I love when recipes like that totally impress me, but I also feel totally at ease making them as well.

I also love to make seafood recipes that I can make in the summer when I’m more likely to have the time to be standing out on the patio grilling. Plus, I find the slight char that the shrimp get from grilling enhances the shrimp flavor. And who doesn’t love that?

There are tons of different recipes for shrimp sorbet floating around out there, but this is my own spin on it. Basically you take shrimp, sour cream, lime juice and juice from a few limes, cilantro, garlic, and a few other ingredients, and you blend and freeze. That’s it.

Because you’re using uncooked shrimp, it takes pretty fast to make. It only needs to be frozen for a few hours to harden up, so you can serve it up relatively quickly. The taste is bright and fresh, and the texture is creamy and smooth. You can serve it up with some grilled veggies, or just devour it straight from the container. I’m a fan of both.
