Strawberries are such a favorite in my home, but you know what else is? Grapes. I know it’s a silly thing to be in love with grapes, but if you’ve ever eaten grapes from a local farm, you get it. They’re like no other grape. They are worth paying extra for.

And yes, I know grapes aren’t really a holiday food, but we love them, so I figured I might as well share my favorite way to eat them with you.

Smoking grapes is so simple and so delicious. It takes maybe ten minutes to prepare and the resulting grapes are utterly addictive. I’ve served these to countless guests and every time they are devoured, so I know you’re going to love this recipe.

I’m so glad I can finally share this with you! For the past three years I’ve been testing different methods, and I’m so happy to say I’ve finally found the best method. It’s so simple, but so impactful. The grapes are covered in smoked salt and then brushed with a mixture of olive oil, balsamic vinegar, honey and fresh thyme.

The flavor of the grapes are so intense, so smoky and so sweet. They literally taste like what you’d imagine heaven to taste like. My family literally sits in front of the grapes until they are all eaten.

These are a fantastic holiday party food or really, they’re a great addition to any gathering. I’m so happy to finally share this with you and have it in my recipe repertoire for years to come.
