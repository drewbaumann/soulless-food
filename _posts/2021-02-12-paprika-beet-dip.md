I’ve been wanting to make a beet dip for years. I love beets. I’ve been eating them for years now. But I don’t love them so much that I’m willing to eat a lot of them. I love them in small amounts. I’m not going to sit down and eat a whole plate of them. I like them as part of a mixed veggie dish, in a salad, or sliced up on the side of a meal.

I love a lot of different veggies, but beets are one of the few veggies that are really special to me. I think it’s because they can taste SO different depending on how they’re prepared. Do you feel that way about beets?

For me, the smokiness of smoked paprika and the slight coating of a dill yogurt sauce make the perfect accoutrement to a pile of roasted beets. The sauce itself is what does it for me, and it’s a keeper. It’s good enough to eat by the spoonful.


## Ingredients:

- 1 large beet, peeled and diced
- 1/2 cup Greek yogurt
- 1/2 cup sour cream
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/4 teaspoon dried dill
- 1/4 teaspoon dried parsley
- 1/4 teaspoon dried basil
- 1/4 teaspoon dried oregano


## Instructions:

1. Boil the beet in a small pot of water until tender (about 15 minutes). Drain and allow to cool.
2. Once cooled, puree the beet in a food processor until smooth.
3. Add the remaining ingredients and blend until smooth.
