Okay. I’m being totally honest here when I say that I’m not a big sweet potato fan. I know, I know, it’s probably sacrilegious to say that in the land of the South. My husband, on the other hand, adores sweet potatoes. I’m more of a savory gal. I also am not a fan of deep fried sweet potato fries. Or, really, any deep fried food.

So when I first created this recipe, I was worried about two things: 1. Would I like these Sweet Potato Fries and 2. Would he? The truth is that I had no problems at all with these fries. They’re simple to make. I love that they’re baked, not fried. And I didn’t have to worry about them being too sweet.

But what I was the most surprised about was the fact that my husband went nuts over these fries. I thought he’d be meh about them. I thought he was just saying he liked them because he didn’t wanna hurt my feelings. But nope, he really likes them. And he actually asks for them all the time now.

These are my go-to easy side dish these days. They’re perfect for a quick dinner or a holiday dinner. I love them because they’re not hard to make and they’re delicious. I actually love any recipe that is simple, and delicious, and will be eaten by the masses.

I make these Sweet Potato Fries a lot. And I’ve watched my recipe time and time again and I can honestly say that this is the best recipe I’ve tried by far. These are easy enough to make for a weeknight dinner. But they’re also delicious and impressive enough to make for a holiday dinner. Honestly, these always get rave reviews!
