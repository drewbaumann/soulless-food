I am 100% obsessed with this candy. Naughty Naked Nougat is not a hard candy, it’s not a lollipop, it’s not a butterscotch, and it’s not a taffy. It’s all of those things and so much more. It is, indeed, a sweet nougat candy with a butterscotch flavor that will blow your taste buds away.

It makes you feel like you are eating candy that you shouldn’t have. A bit naughty and yet oh so nice. It’s chewy and soft, but not too soft that it breaks apart in your mouth – it just melts and melts in your mouth. The flavor is super strong and the aroma is sweet and tangy. I seriously love this candy. I have it every single year at Christmas, and I’m so glad I found it.

I can’t wait to try it on ice cream, or just have a handful because it’s so good. I really like that it has a butterscotch flavor, because butterscotch is my absolute favorite. And the texture is just perfect. It’s hard to describe. You just need to get it and see for yourself. Don’t miss out!
