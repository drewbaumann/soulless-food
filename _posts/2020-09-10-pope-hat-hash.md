Is there anything better than a hash for breakfast? No, I don’t think so. Hash is just the perfect southern comfort food breakfast. It’s simple, filling (pretty much the way you want to start your day), and most importantly delicious. I’ve come to love a good hash for breakfast over the years, especially during the holidays.

Because if you’re anything like me, mornings get hectic around holidays (or any time of year really). Going out for breakfast is just not going to happen. You’re trying to get everyone to go to church, the tree needs to be decorated, presents need to be wrapped, and on and on. So on most days, I’m left scrambling to get things done and figure out what everyone is going to eat.

A good old fashioned hash is the perfect make ahead breakfast to have on hand. It can be prepared the night before, or early in the morning (if you’re up and at ’em early) and then popped in the oven when you’re ready. You can top it with eggs, or go with a side of biscuits, or just eat it by itself. No matter how you prepare a hash, you’re going to love it!

I’ve been making this one for years. It started out as a brown sugar hash, but then I started adding a few ingredients to kick things up a notch and make it a little more special. The ham adds some great flavor and texture to the hash and the cream cheese just adds a little something extra. If you’re a fan of a good cream cheese dish, as in cheesecake or mac n’ cheese, you may just love this one.

I’ll warn you that this is a fairly basic hash. So it might not be the best choice if you’re looking for a lot of flavor and spice. But if you like a good, old fashioned hash, then this is the one for you!
