I’ve got a confession. I used to be a super carb-phobic person. I’d eat pasta or potatoes with the tiniest bit of meat on top. Like, the tiniest. Even now, I’m not a big carb eater. But I’ve really come to the conclusion that you can’t just cut out carbs altogether. They’re just too good to completely ignore.

Sometimes I just need a little something with a big carb. And this Cinnamon Lavender Toast is perfect. Honestly, it’s not even a recipe, I just toast some bread, slather on some butter, add a bit of honey, and sprinkle on some herbs and spices…and you have a perfect Christmas breakfast, lunch, or dinner.

But seriously, you need this in your life. It’s crispy, crunchy, sweet, and makes the house smell like Christmas. And really, even if you decide to make it in July, you’ll still love it!


## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup (60g) almond flour
- 1/4 cup (30g) tapioca flour
- 1/4 cup (30g) coconut flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp ground cinnamon
- 1/2 tsp dried lavender buds
- 1/2 cup (115g) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/2 tsp almond extract
- 1/4 cup (60g) milk of choice
- 2 tsp granulated sugar (for topping)


## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C).
2. In a large bowl, combine the flours, baking powder, salt, cinnamon and lavender. In a separate bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the egg, vanilla extract and almond extract and mix until well combined.
3. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Add the milk and mix until well combined.
4. Scoop the batter into a piping bag fitted with a large round tip. Pipe the batter onto a parchment paper or silicone lined baking sheet into 1-1 1/2 inch circles. Sprinkle each circle with a little granulated sugar.
5. Bake for 8-10 minutes. The edges should be golden brown and the tops should look dry. Allow to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.
6. Serve with a drizzle of honey, jam or your favorite frosting.
