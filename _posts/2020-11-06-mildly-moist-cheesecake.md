I did a post last year on the Best Cheesecake…ever. It’s a classic, “old school” recipe, but it really is the best cheesecake recipe ever. And that’s coming from someone who doesn’t even like cheesecake. But, my husband, he’s a real cheesecake lover. And this one is so good that I can enjoy it too.

So, I thought I’d do another cheesecake recipe this year. And it’s yet another old school recipe. I’m sorry, but I just love all the classic recipes. I do try to get creative and create new recipes, but then I miss the classics. So I end up creating new versions of old recipes. I think I’m a little obsessed with these old-school recipes.

I’m also obsessed with cheesecake and I don’t even like cheesecake. I know, I’m weird. But c’mon, cheesecake is great, but the drier, harder cheesecakes, are not so great. They’re just not the ideal texture and that’s why I love this classic cheesecake recipe, it’s not dry at all.

The Best Cheesecake is quite well known, but this recipe is not, I just found it in an old cookbook of my mother’s (I’m sure it’s from the 70’s or something). It looks like it came from the LA Times. It’s a good recipe. But not quite as good as the Best Cheesecake. It’s still a solid recipe and a great cheesecake.

And I’m sure I’ll have more “old school” recipes in the coming weeks and months. I know you have some favorites too. Some tried and true recipes that you go to time and time again over the years. Please share them with me, I’d love to add them to my list!

I also wanted to let you know that in the coming weeks I’ll be taking a little break from the blog. I’ll be traveling to Florida with my family over Christmas, and with a few other things going on, I’m going to take a two or three week break from the blog. I’ll be back after the New Year and there
