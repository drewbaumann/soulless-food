There are two types of people in this world: those that are a fan of green bean casserole, and those that are a hater. If you have never had green bean casserole, then you just gotta make this cookies because you will fall in love with this classic dish. It is best described as the ultimate holiday side dish.

I am in the former category. I love green bean casserole. The dish is lovely, and I so look forward to it every year.

If you are in the latter category, then you will not enjoy this cookies. But you can always substitute a nice chocolate chip cookie for the green bean cookies.

*Editors’ Note: Since writing this post a couple years ago, I’ve expanded this dessert to include 6 recipes: Green Bean Casserole Cookies, Raspberry Sugar Cookies, Chocolate Sugar Cookies, Peanut Butter Blossoms, Cheesecake Stuffed Cookie Cups, and Raspberry White Chocolate Cheesecake Bars.


## Ingredients

* 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened
* 1 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup brown sugar
* 2 eggs

* 2 teaspoons vanilla extract

* 2 cups all-purpose flour
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 cup green beans, cooked and chopped (about 1/2 pound)

* 1/2 cup raspberry preserves
* 1/2 cup chopped walnuts


## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.

2. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugars until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs and vanilla.

3. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt. Add the flour mixture to the butter mixture and stir until just combined. Fold in the green beans and walnuts.

4. Drop the dough by rounded tablespoons onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake until golden, 12 to 14 minutes. Cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

5. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir together the raspberry preserves and 1 tablespoon water.

6. Spread the cookies with the raspberry preserves.

7. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
