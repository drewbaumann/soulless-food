In my opinion, this Blackened Vanilla Cake is the perfect vanilla cake – just the right amount of vanilla, yum. This cake is completely from scratch, even the frosting is homemade! The cake is moist and rich, and the frosting is sweet and creamy. If you love vanilla cakes, this should be on your list of cakes to bake!


Ingredients:

- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
- 1/8 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/4 cup butter, melted
- 1/4 cup brown sugar

Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Grease and flour a 9-inch round cake pan and set aside.
2. In a medium sized bowl, combine flour, baking powder and salt and set aside.
3. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar until light in color and fluffy. You should be able to see the change in color happen and know it’s ready.
4. Add the egg and mix until well combined.
5. Add the vanilla extract and mix until well combined.
6. Add the dry ingredients and mix until the dough is well combined. It will be thick and shouldn’t be sticky. Do not over mix. Once it’s well combined, use a rubber spatula to help it come together to form a more cohesive ball.
7. Pour batter into the prepared pan and bake for 20-25 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.
8. Remove from the oven and allow to cool on a wire rack for 10 minutes.
9. In a small bowl, combine the melted butter, brown sugar and cinnamon and mix until well combined.
10. Pour the butter mixture over the cake and allow to cool completely.
11. Serve with vanilla ice cream, whipped cream or as is.
