Veal is a polarizing meat. Most people either love it or hate it. I’ve heard a lot of people say they’d rather eat a cow than eat veal. I’m not going to lie, since I’ve only ever made veal once before, I was a little nervous about doing it. However, I got this recipe from my husband’s Italian grandma, so I knew this couldn’t be bad.

I was nervous about the veal being tough, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was SO tender and delicious! And the other thing I was unsure about was the sauce. It’s called “sweaty veal chops” and basically, the meat is browned and then braised in a pot with onions, garlic, white wine, Italian seasoning, some veggies, and a little tomato sauce.

At first I was worried the tomato sauce would ruin it. I’m not a huge tomato sauce fan, and I thought maybe it would make the dish too heavy. But the flavors are balanced perfectly. The taste is influenced by the fresh ingredients and really brightens up the dish.

These are so delicious, and while this veal recipe was a little more time consuming than I expected, it was worth it. I’ll definitely be making these again soon!
