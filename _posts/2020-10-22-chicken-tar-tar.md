I made these Tar Tar Bites for Christmas Eve this year and they were such a hit. I’ve been wanting to make them for a few years and finally decided to give them a go. The recipe comes from a cookbook I purchased several years back called, “Everyday Delicious” by Michelle Bernstein. I love this cookbook and actually, I know I’m not alone in saying this. If you’ve never used this cookbook, it’s one I highly recommend. So many great recipes! You can find this cookbook on Amazon here.

I had a friend of mine over for dinner on Christmas Eve and we served these Tar Tar bites as an appetizer and they were the talk of the night. They were a hit all around. They also happen to be really easy to make, which is always a plus. You can serve them as an appetizer or if you want, make them into our secondary main dish and serve them as a main course. There are so many ways to customize the recipe.

These chicken tar tar bites are typically served with a pesto sauce. This is where you can be creative and add in whatever ingredients you like. I chose to stick with traditional flavors and paired them with the pesto. They are very flavorful and made with a delicious creamy sauce. If you’ve never had Tar Tar, they are a bit like chicken nuggets. They are very tender and fall apart easily, so be careful when assembling them.

If you’re looking for a tasty appetizer or main dish, these are the perfect way to go. The flavor combinations in the chicken are just perfect. And the sweet and creamy sauce is a perfect foil for the chicken.
