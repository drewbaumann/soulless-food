I know I’ve been posting a lot of breakfast and brunch recipes lately, but don’t forget that I’m the girl who’s obsessed with the idea of a Spaghetti Omelette Sandwich, so this fits right into my wheelhouse.

I’ve long said that the main reason my husband and I have 2 kids is that I’d never have time to eat a spaghetti omelette sandwich. I have a ton of ideas for them and I’d like to try them all, but I’d need to clone myself to have enough time to do it all.

So this blog has been my way of keeping track of all the spaghetti omelette sandwich ideas in my head. They are, after all, my favorite kind of omelette, they just need a lot of extra time and stuff and hey! This blog is a great outlet for such things.

I started with a basic omelette recipe and worked from there. I knew I wanted it to have the classic spaghetti omelette sandwich flavors – juicy sausage, mushrooms and onions, and melty cheese. I also wanted it to be in sandwich form, which added a few more layers of complexity (so many things you need to remember when flipping a sandwich).

Basically what I did was separate the ingredients – I poured some into each half of the pan and worked my way around the pan (once the eggs were cooked), before adding the cheese and cooking it a bit longer.

I like to think of it as a deconstructed spaghetti omelette sandwich. I got all the best parts, but it’s not quite as messy that way, and I can make it in a way that I really can’t with a sandwich, so I LOVE that about it.


## Ingredients:
- 2 eggs
- 1/4 cup milk
- 1/2 cup spaghetti
- 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded
- 1/2 cup tomato sauce
- 1 teaspoon oregano
- 1 teaspoon basil
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional)
- 1 tablespoon butter
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 2 slices bread


## Instructions:

1. Cook spaghetti according to package instructions. Drain and set aside.
2. Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat.
3. Whisk together eggs, milk, oregano, basil, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder and crushed red pepper flakes in a bowl.
4. Pour egg mixture into the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes or until the bottom is set.
5. Add spaghetti and mozzarella cheese to one side of the omelette.
6. Using a spatula, flip the other side of the omelette over the spaghetti and cheese.
7. Cook for an additional 2-3 minutes or until the cheese has melted.
8. Remove from heat and place the omelette on a slice of bread.
9. Top with tomato sauce and the other slice of bread.
10. Enjoy!
