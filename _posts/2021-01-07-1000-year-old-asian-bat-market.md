This is the story of how Alice and I got a 1000 year old Asian Bat! Not really, but we totally did!

We decided to go to the 1000 year old Asian Bat Market on this trip, because itâ€™s the biggest one in the world, and in the end, we found that it was just a normal market that sold a lot of stuff. We got there on a Sunday morning, and it was really crowded. On the day we went, there was a small event going on inside the market. They had arts and crafts stalls set up so that you could buy gifts to take home. There was also a stage with live music.

After we finished exploring the market, we walked around the area before heading back to our hotel. We took a few pictures, because it was a beautiful neighborhood.
