I’ll admit, I’ve never been a huge fan of plain popcorn. I do love a good buttery popcorn with some salt on it, and it’s probably one of my favorite snacks, but it can’t hold its own in the dessert category. I knew I wanted to make something frosted for the holidays, but I also knew I wanted something that could hold its own in the snack department, and I’ve found that this recipe is the perfect solution!

I’m a huge fan of popcorn. It’s probably my favorite snack. I love that you can make it at home without any extra ingredients, like butter and salt, but it’s also a great option for movie night. All you need is a good popcorn popper, and you’re good to go!

But plain popcorn is just not good as a dessert. I had to jazz it up a bit. So I came up with this recipe of popcorn drizzled in white chocolate and then topped with M&M’s. It’s the perfect option for movie night or for holiday entertaining. And it’s also a fun option for gift giving too!

- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup powdered sugar
- 1/2 cup mini chocolate chips
- 1/4 cup peanuts (optional)

Instructions:

1. Place butter in a medium saucepan and melt. Add brown sugar, corn syrup, corn syrup, water, vanilla, baking soda, and salt. Stir to combine and bring to a boil.
2. Once mixture is boiling, remove from heat and stir in powdered sugar.
3. Pour over popcorn and stir until evenly coated.
4. Add chocolate chips and peanuts and stir to combine.
5. Spread popcorn onto wax paper and let cool.
