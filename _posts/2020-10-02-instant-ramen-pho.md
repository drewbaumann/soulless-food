You guys, I know what you’re thinking, and you’re right – this isn’t really a recipe. But I just HAD to include it because it’s awesome. I’ve started making this Instant Ramen Pho at least once a month. It’s just that good.

Instant Ramen Pho is one of those meals that kind of sneaks up on you, it’s so good! I had it for the first time when my husband was still in college and he kept making it, literally, every other week. We joked that it was his “gourmet” meal for the week. I laughed at the time, but seriously, this is pretty much gourmet. It’s filled with healthy ingredients, has bold flavors, and tastes incredible.

Seriously, how good does this look?

My husband is now a Senior in college, and he still requests this at least once a month. We joke that one night he’s going to put up Instant Ramen Pho on our money tree and we’ll never have to worry about what to make for dinner again. But seriously, this stuff is the best. Good job, Me, for putting this in my life.

PS – if you’re looking for a great ramen, I highly recommend Maruchan Yakisoba Chow Mein Top Ramen. It’s the one I get every time. Let me know what kind you love in the comments below!
