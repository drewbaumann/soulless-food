I’m sorry, but these muffins are just awesome. They’re that delicious mix of tart and sweet that you get with cherry blossom flavored things. My mother in law grew up in Japan, so now every spring she makes tons of cherry blossom things. She made cherry blossom cupcakes, cherry blossom pasta and I saw a cherry blossom fruit punch, but I think I like this cherry blossom muffin the best.

It’s just so light and soft and the fresh cherry blossom flavor totally comes through. Plus, there’s a surprise inside. I know, I know, you can’t see it and I won’t tell you what it is. But let’s just say it’s totally worth it. These muffins are the bomb.com. Don’t believe me? Just make them and then come back and tell me how much you loved them.
