For as long as I can remember, my mom has loved wine. From Riesling to Merlot, to Pino Grigio and beyond, she’s always had a bottle in the fridge. So it’s kind of no surprise that I inherited her love of wine.

Though I’d much rather indulge in good wine than good beer, I do enjoy a good brew. My favorite drink to order at a bar is usually a Moscow Mule. Last year I came across a Beaujolais Remoulade recipe in an old cookbook and decided to give it a try. I’m so glad I did. It was actually the first time I’d tasted wine coolers, I’d never even heard of them before. The combination of the Beaujolais Nouveau and the remoulade dressing did me in. Give it a try and I bet it will do you in too.
