Beaujolais Remoulade is my new obsession. In fact, I made it twice in one week. And then my mom (who’s a total pickle lover) ate it and was all, “You have to come make this for us!”. So I did. And she ate none. I, however, ate a bunch.

Beaujolais is a French wine region, just north of Lyon. It’s the main red wine of France, and it’s a classic (and seriously great) match for our favorite burger of all time, le Hamburger Francais.

Beaujolais Remoulade is a French classic, which is commonly served with le Hamburger Francais. And because I love me some good classic burgers, I couldn’t help but to love it too. I’d never actually had it, though, and I was all, “What is this magical thing?”.

As I’ve mentioned in many recipes, because I’ve played around with so many versions of this one, I decided that the classic recipe is a must. It’s the perfect version of this great and super easy to prepare dish.

The thing that makes remoulade so wonderful is the combination of flavors. Mustard, pickles, and mayo. It’s a magical combination, and one we all love. You can serve it as a dip, or all on its own with some toasted bread. It’s a classic that doesn’t need any frills.

Just pickles, mayo, and mustard. Simple but delicious – the way food should be.
