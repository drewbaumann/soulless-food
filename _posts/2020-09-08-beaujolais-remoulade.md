I didn’t grow up eating much cole slaw, except for the occasional BBQ joint version. Cole slaw really wasn’t a thing in our house. We had the occasional tuna, but we always had potato and macaroni salads. And you can’t have a picnic, cookout, or get together without a classic (read: boring) potato salad.

But my husband grew up on cole slaw, so it’s kind of his ethnic dish. So I’ve learned to make it at home to keep him happy. I want to say that I’ve attempted to make 23 different cole slaw recipes on this blog alone (this includes a couple variations of the same one). I’ve tried it with and without mayo, with and without vinegar, thick and creamy, thin and crunchy. I’ve made it with shredded, with cubed, with rice and with breadcrumbs. Trust me, I’ve done it all.

And this recipe? It’s the best. Hands down.

I can’t say it’s the best made with mayo, it’s not. I don’t like mayo, so I generally don’t use it. Not every recipe or meal should be made with mayo, right? But you could totally use it here. And it could still be the best cole slaw you’ve ever had. The dressing is just incredible, and it’s what makes this cabbage dish so darn good.

So while this is labeled as Beaujolais Remoulade, it’s really just a super simple cole slaw. And it’s the best (and most flavorful) cole slaw I’ve ever had.
