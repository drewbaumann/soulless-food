If you’ve never had mead, you need to, and you need to do it soon. And then you need to make some of this mulled mead. It’s a classic winter drink, and I love the warm spiciness of the cloves, nutmeg, and cinnamon.

I really loved making a mulled mead version of the drink. You could also use store-bought mead as well, but I’d recommend making some yourself. It’s not difficult, and I promise you’ll have the best mead you’ve ever had if you make your own.


## Ingredients:

- 1 gallon mead (honey wine)
- 1 orange, sliced
- 1 lemon, sliced
- 1 apple, cored and sliced
- 1 cinnamon stick
- 1/2 teaspoon whole cloves
- 1/2 teaspoon whole allspice
- 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns
- 1/4 cup honey
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1/4 cup orange juice
- 1/4 cup lemon juice
- 1/2 cup brandy


## Instructions:

1. Add the mead, orange slices, lemon slices, apple slices, cinnamon stick, cloves, allspice and peppercorns to a large pot.

2. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 20 minutes.

3. Add the honey, brown sugar, orange juice, lemon juice and brandy.

4. Simmer for another 30 minutes.

5. Strain the mead into a large bowl or pitcher.

6. Serve hot.

7. Enjoy!
