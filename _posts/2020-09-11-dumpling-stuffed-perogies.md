I’m sure you have your favorite dishes that you make for the holidays. In our family we eat a few. But one that’s always on the menu is dumplings. They’re a classic food, they’re easy, they’re delicious, and I’ll never get enough.

I love that you can make a big pot of dumplings and serve them with so much. I frequently serve dumplings with Heirloom Tomato Salad, Pork Tenderloin, as a side to any meat, or just by themselves. But today I’m sharing the dumplings stuffed perogies, which have recently become a favorite of my husband’s.

If you’re looking for a last minute dish for Christmas, this one’s about as easy as it gets. You also might want to double up on ingredients so you have leftovers. And, if you’re looking for an appetizer for a party, these are perfect.

Enjoy!
