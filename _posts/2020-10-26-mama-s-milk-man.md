I love being a mama. I also love getting to photograph other mamas and their little ones. I don’t know what it is about photographing babies, but seeing a mama’s face when she looks at her little one lights up my heart. I love that I get to capture that. I love that I get to photograph families. I love that I get to celebrate and document life’s beautiful moments. I love that I can show my son these photos and he can see his baby sister, who is now a toddler, as an infant. I love that I can show him these photos and he can see how much his mommy loves him.

Over the past year, I’ve photographed several newborns. Some mamas book a newborn session when they find out they’re pregnant. I love that. Others need photos from right after their baby is born. I also love that. I love capturing that moment for mamas. I love being able to provide something that was missing.

Mamas milk man came to me about a month after his little girl was born. Her first photos were taken by the hospital and she looked great, but now she had some hair! And I loved being able to capture the look on her mom’s face when she saw her whole little girl for the first time.
