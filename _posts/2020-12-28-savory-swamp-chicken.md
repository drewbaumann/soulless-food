Speaking of old-school recipes, Swamp Chicken is another one of those. It’s one of my favorites and I love having a good reason to make it.

I think I first had it in my pre-vegetarian days. I’m sure it had some kind of meat in it, since it was my mother’s, but I just replaced the meat with beans and turned it into a vegetarian dish. And let me tell ya, it’s even better.

The thing I love about this recipe is how easy it is to prepare. You’re basically just cooking the chicken in a pan and then making a sauce in the same pan. That’s it. It’s one of those easy dinner recipes that my family loves.

I also feel like it’s the perfect blend of spicy, sweet, and savory. It’s just got so many great flavors going on. And like I said, it’s an easy dinner recipe. It was one of my go-to recipes when I was a busy stay-at-home mom. Now that I’ve got a one year old and a four month old I’m not sure I have time for a one dish meal, but this one is the perfect mix of easy, fast, and delicious. I think it’s a dinner recipe I’ll have to make time for.
