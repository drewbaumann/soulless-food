I love making super garlicky meals (we usually have some sort of garlicy meal at least once a week). There’s just something about the flavor that I really love. So when I was planning what I wanted to make for lunch this past week, I knew I wanted to try out a new recipe that involved lots of garlic.

Recently I had seen a recipe on Pinterest for a chicken curry that used garlic, and had been wanting to try it. So I decided that I would make a Garlic Chicken recipe instead. I also wanted to try a different kind of sauce on the chicken, so I went with a lemon sauce this time around.

I made this Particular Garlic Chicken recipe for lunch and I loved it. It wasn’t as spicy as I thought it would be, which was actually perfect. The sauce was nice and tangy without being too much of either. The garlic and lemon are a perfect combination and really bring the chicken to life.

This one is definitely a keeper in my book!


## Ingredients:

- 1 1/2 to 2 pounds (700 to 900 grams) boneless, skinless chicken thighs

- 1/2 teaspoon salt

- 1/2 teaspoon fresh ground black pepper

- 2 tablespoons olive oil

- 2 tablespoons butter

- 4 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 tablespoons)

- 1/4 cup dry white wine or broth

- 1/4 cup chopped parsley

- 1/4 cup chopped fresh chives

- 1/4 cup chopped fresh basil

- 1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro


## Instructions:

1. Season chicken with salt and pepper and set aside.

2. Heat olive oil and butter in a large pan or skillet. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant (about 30 seconds - 1 minute). Then add the chicken, season with salt and pepper to taste and sauté for 1-2 minutes on one side (until just beginning to turn pink), then flip.

3. Pour in wine (or broth), add fresh herbs. Bring to a simmer for 1-2 minutes or until wine reduces by about half and the chicken is cooked through (don't over cook your chicken).

4. Stir in the remaining butter, basil and cilantro and take off heat immediately.

5. Serve over rice, pasta, garlic bread or steamed vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, zucchini noodles).
