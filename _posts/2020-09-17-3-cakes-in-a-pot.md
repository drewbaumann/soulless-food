So I’m sure a few of you have heard of 3 cakes in a pot – aka a 3 layer cake in a crock pot – but I haven’t seen many recipes for them.

In fact, I didn’t even have a recipe for one until a couple years ago when I had this idea to make one for a huge potluck at church for their members and friends. I knew this would be an event, and I didn’t want to serve the same old stuff. I decided to make something that would really wow them. So basically, I had 2 weeks to figure out how to make a 3 layer cake in a crock pot.

Anyway, I tried a few recipes, combined all the best parts of each, and came out with this 3 Cakes in a Pot recipe. It’s pretty damn good – it uses a boxed yellow cake mix, and mixes up really quickly. I mean, it’s super simple to make. And it’s really delicious. It’s a yellow cake with chocolate chips (of course) and a creamy chocolate marshmallow frosting. YUM!

And guess what? It works! It really works. The cake cooks perfectly in a crock pot. Just like a regular cake. The frosting is super creamy and marshmallowy. It’s to die for. Trust me, a 3 layer chocolate cake cooked in a crock pot is pretty much the best thing ever.
