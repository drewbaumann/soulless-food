I’m pretty sure the French call it something else, but I say it my way and I say it’s good. You’re just going to have to trust me on this one.

The other day, I was talking to a client who was going to be making her husband dinner when he got home from a long day of work. I told her to make a French forced foal. She asked me to please explain what it was. I obliged, saying it was a French version of a beef stew, just add garlic, and that it’s fabulous.

Her husband thanked me on the phone. I then told him that his wife was my new hero, and I proceeded to tell him the story about the French and the forced foal. He replied, “Well, now I look forward to coming home.” Nice try, buddy.

I’m not sure where this dish originated. I think it was invented in a small countryside French town after the French were forced to eat horses, oh, and two months worth of it with no end in sight. You know, the usual story. I’m not sure about that part. But I do know that I’m a fan.

I’m sure it was originally made with a horse, but I use beef. I’m not to sure about the rest, except that it’s pretty much awesome. It’s a classic French bistro dish, and it’s hearty, with big flavors. It’s comfort in a bowl.


## Ingredients:

- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1/2 cup granulated sugar
- 1 large egg

- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/4 cup heavy cream
- 1/4 cup powdered sugar
- 1/4 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 teaspoon almond extract
- 1/2 cup sliced almonds
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
- 1/4 cup sliced almonds
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
- 1/4 cup sliced almonds
- 1/4 cup granulated sugar
- 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/2 teaspoon almond extract
- 1/4 cup sliced almonds

## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
2. Combine the butter and sugar in a large mixer bowl on medium speed until light in color and fluffy. You should be able to see the change in color happen and know it’s ready.
3. Add the egg and mix until well combined.
4. Add the vanilla extract and mix until well combined.
5. Add the flour, baking powder and salt and mix until the dough is well combined. It will be thick and shouldn’t be sticky. Do not over mix. Once it’s well combined, use a rubber spatula to help it come together to form a more cohesive ball.
6. Add the milk and cream and mix until well combined.
7. Add the powdered sugar and mix until well combined.
8. Add the vanilla extract, almond extract, almonds, cinnamon and sugar and mix until well combined.
9. Use a tablespoon sized cookie dough scoop to create 1 1/2 tablespoon sized balls of cookie dough. Gently roll into a ball, then roll each ball in the additional sugar to coat. Set the balls on the baking sheet.
10. Bake cookies for 7-8 minutes
