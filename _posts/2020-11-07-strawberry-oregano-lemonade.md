Last but certainly not least, this Strawberry Oregano Lemonade.

I have two words for you – fresh and fruity. I could take or leave the strawberries in the middle of winter. But in the summer, when berries are fresh and in season? I am totally on board. And when strawberries marry well with so many other flavors (like basil, oregano, lemon, and more) I call that bringing a recipe to the next level.

The strawberries in this Strawberry Oregano Lemonade are just the star of the show, and they are breathtaking. They have such a bright, fresh, sweet flavor – I can’t get enough of them. In the summer and early fall, I’m always trying to find ways to use up strawberries before they go bad. I don’t want them to go bad. It makes me sad.

So I figured, what better way to use them up than to make Strawberry Oregano Lemonade. I’d seen a version of this recipe with strawberries floating in the drink, but I wanted to take it further. I wanted a drink that was fresh, but it was also bright and clean, with just the right amount of fresh strawberry flavor.

I used a mix of strawberry juices and purees, a whole lotta fresh lemon juice, a whole bunch of chopped fresh strawberries, and fresh chopped oregano. The lemon juice is what really makes this recipe shine, but the strawberry + oregano combination is what gives it a bright fresh flavor that makes me want to drink it at every possible moment.

Trust me, you need to make this recipe. Or if you already have, you need to make it again.

So there you have it, my ten favorite recipes I made in 2015.

The truth is, I don’t really have a recipe that I made this year that I don’t like. I don’t have any recipes that I’m like, “meh, that wasn’t worth it.” Every year, I have recipes that I make over and over. I have my “throw together” recipes that are always delicious. I have my tried and true recipes that I know will never fail me. And I have my recipes that I make and look at and go, “this is one of my best ever.”

And I made a lot of really good recipes this
