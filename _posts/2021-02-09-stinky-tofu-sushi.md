Missed the boat on making Stinky Tofu for Christmas? Well, it’s ok, you can still make it! Or if you just want to make something new this year, try Stinky Tofu Sushi!

I know a lot of you have never had Stinky Tofu, so let me tell you a little bit about it. It’s basically fermented Tofu, which sounds like a total nightmare, but trust me, it’s not. This Stinky Tofu recipe is totally doable, and actually delicious!

Stinky Tofu is actually really popular in Asia, and because it’s so funky, you don’t have to worry about your stinkiness rubbing off on anyone (thank goodness). Now, since I’m not a huge sushi fan (or I guess I should say I’m not a big fan of raw fish fan), I decided to make the Stinky Tofu into Sushi.

And if you’re going to make sushi, why not make Stinky Tofu Sushi? It’s a little bit of a machine (and it’s seriously messy), but I promise it’s worth it.

I used to think sushi had to be this super fancy meal, but when I tried Sticky Tofu Sushi, I realized that sushi is just tasty stuff wrapped in seaweed. Which meant I could make it at home! I want to note that this is no traditional sushi, but if you’ve never made sushi at home, it’s actually quite easy.

I made sushi rice because it’s a bit healthier (and controls the sticky factor), I used smoked salmon because I’m not a big fan of raw fish, and used lots of delicious veggies. I also used my favorite sushi rolling mat, which made rolling so easy and really helped control the sticky factor.

I love this Sticky Tofu Sushi because it’s just so damn tasty. I mean, who would have thought Stinky Tofu could be so good!
