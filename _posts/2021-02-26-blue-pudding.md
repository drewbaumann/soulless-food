This Blue Pudding was born out of a mistake. But I just kept going with it, and it ended up being one of my favorite recipes of the year. You see, I was making a batch of red velvet cake, and I accidentally added blue food coloring. (I didn’t realize it was blue until it had already baked!) So rather than toss it, I made a batch of vanilla pudding and layered it in the middle.

The result was heavenly. The red velvet cake was a little dense, but moist, and just plain delicious. I didn’t want to cover that up with frosting. The pudding was the perfect choice. It was creamy, rich, and tart. And it paired so well with the cake.

I’ve since made this recipe again, but with white cake, and the layered pudding gave it a totally different feel. But both recipes are insanely delicious. In fact, I love it so much, I’ve been trying to find other recipes to layer pudding in. Of course, I’d like to find one that is any good, but we are still working on that.
