I know you might think that’s a funny combination, but trust me when I say it’s amazing! I’ve been doing these on our campfires for years. They’re SOOO good. I just love that creamy, smooth, and slightly sweet taste of the marshmallows melting over the top of the hot melted chocolate. It’s heaven.

If you’re camping with friends, or even family, these smores are a hit. They’ll disappear in just a few minutes. My husband and I have been know to eat at least 8 mushroom smores in one sitting. Just one after the other. I’m not even kidding.

I just used regular white button mushrooms but the larger Champignon would work well too. I added the Worcestershire to give it a little extra flavour, but you can leave it out if you want to. If you’re not a fan of Worcestershire, you could add a little garlic or onion powder.

I used my Marshmello Chocolate Melting wafers for the chocolate, but you could also use a bar of dark chocolate. If you’re serving these at home I’d use dark chocolate, because the melty marshmallows will melt the chocolate – and it might be a bit too rich, even for my taste.

What are your Thanksgiving and Christmas traditions? Do you have any “old school” favorites like the ones I have?
