I know what you’re thinking….ugh gross.

I’m not sure how I came up with this recipe but I can tell you it was a very unhealthy time in my life. I was always try to find ways to get protein in my diet because I eat vegetarian and it’s not the easiest thing out there. It would be one thing if I lived in a place that offered a lot of vegetarian options but I don’t, so, I had to get creative. I do love fish, but I don’t like eating it very often because I don’t like it all that much. I’m sure that sounds weird to some, but I’m a picky eater.

So, at the time I was eating a lot of beans and rice, pasta, etc. I thought I’d try to make and Italian meatball, using beans as a binder and then put it on top of a bed of pasta with some homemade marinara sauce. It was pretty much a disaster. I’d seen a post on pinterest (which I can’t find) that said you could make bolognese sauce using brown sugar to help it caramelize. I thought why not try that, and make a ball out of it and then cook it. So, I did. I was hoping it wouldn’t be terrible, but I was pleasantly surprised. It was actually pretty delicious. So, I had a few extra and decided to make a dip to take to a New Years party we were going to.

For some reason I thought it would be a fun idea to mix it with a can of tuna and serve it with crackers. I can’t tell you why I thought this was a good idea, but I didn’t know what a can of tuna tasted like because I don’t eat fish. Well, it turned out to be the best tuna salad I have ever had. Seriously. I couldn’t believe how good it was.

I love it spread on crostini with a drizzle of olive oil. I love it with crusty bread, I love it in a wrap. It’s like a tuna salad and a spinach dip had a baby and it loved me. The olive and lobster combination works really well. I remember the first time I tried it I didn’t think it would but it was really good.
