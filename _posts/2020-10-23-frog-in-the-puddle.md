I am a HUGE sucker for cute kid’s crafts. The more simple and adorable the better (is that just me?). And while I may be past the stage of doing arts and crafts a ton with my kids (Landon is 6 and Ash is 3), I can’t help but love the craft and art work they still do on their own. They’re always coming up with creative things to do to entertain themselves.

The other night Landon decided to make a frog in a puddle. And I was really proud of him that he took the initiative on his own to make this happen. So proud. The one thing I would suggest if you have a kid who wants to do this is to use something other than a permanent marker. For some reason Landon liked to color in the puddle…with blue water. And he wasn’t super careful about it either.

So after many attempts and getting blue water all over his room, I told him he could use the markers directly on the paper. And Voila! There you have it – frog in the puddle.
