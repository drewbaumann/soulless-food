I’m a cold weather loving girl. But I’m also a fan of turning on the stove to make myself a hot bowl of comfort food. Water is cold, and broth is perfect for the season. And then there’s Macaroni Soup. It’s all I want to eat when I’m in a comfort food mood.

Macaroni soup is one of my favorite things to eat in the world. And I’ve just updated my mother’s old, classic recipe so that it’s even better. I’m ready to tackle the cold winter with this soup.

My mom’s recipe was a simple one, boiling water with veggies and then adding in the uncooked macaroni (like a good old fashioned macaroni and cheese, only obviously not cheesy). But once the pasta was cooked, a touch of cream went in along with cheese. It was SO good. But it was also missing something. It needed an extra something. It needed more deliciousness.

That’s why this new version is so much better. It’s the perfect winter comfort food update. I added some mustard because 1) I love me some mustard and 2) it’s just a great flavor to add to any soup. Then I added a few other items for that extra oomph, like a touch of flour, garlic and a few spices. It makes the perfect base for this simple soup.

It also just happens to be a super easy little dinner to make, too. Boil the pasta, add in the veggies, then combine and add some cheese. That’s it. And then you’re ready to chow down.
