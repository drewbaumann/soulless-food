I know a lot of people have been curious about my food styling and photography. And I know that often times, it’s easy to just take a quick iPhone pic and post it. BUT I’m saying all that to say, I’m SO excited to share this photo shoot with you guys because to me it was a major accomplishment. It’s crazy how much work goes into a shoot like this.

And as you can tell, it was a lot of work. There were two main reasons I wanted to share this shoot. I wanted to prove to myself that I could do it and I also wanted to show everyone the different elements that go into a shoot like this. There’s a lot more that goes into it than I think many people realize.

I’ve always dreamed of having a photo shoot like this – a shoot with a real prop stylist, a real food stylist, real hair and makeup artists. These are all people who I’ve worked with over the years, so it was awesome to bring them in to do what they do best.

The actual food part was super fun and definitely not as hard as I thought it would be. Each spread took about 2 hours, and then I’d take about 45 minutes to an hour to edit a few photos. And wow did that ever take a long time. I guess I’m spoiled because I’ve got some editing down to a science, but still, 2 or 3 hours to edit a photo is pretty time consuming.

We had tons of fun making these food shots, and I hope the photos show that. I think in the end, the most rewarding part was seeing how the styling compared to my own. In my own food styling, I tend to go for a more “rustic” look. I think of it as more “home cooking”. The dishes look pretty simple, but are fancy enough for a dinner party.

This shoot took more of a restaurant approach. The dishes were a lot fancier, which was a fun change. I had the opportunity to play with some decanters and other fancy serving pieces for the first time, and I’m psyched to have gotten to try those out.

I’m so excited to share these photos with you. I hope you love them as much as I do!
