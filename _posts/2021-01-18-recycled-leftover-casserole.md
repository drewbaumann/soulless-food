This recipe is a total game-changer. It’s SO GOOD. And SO easy. And SO a no-brainer if you’re making a big family dinner and need a good side dish! Basically it’s a concept that I don’t know why any of us would pass over, when it’s so easy to create something so tasty and good. It’s basically an omelet/frittata hybrid. You can use any ingredients your heart desires. I’ve made this with all kinds of fillings and it’s always a hit. Plus it’s an easy side dish to prepare ahead of time and keep in the fridge until you’re ready to serve it!
