I’m embarrassed to admit that I have never eaten a Mufaletta before today. I’ve driven right by a couple places that serve them and never once stopped. I guess I just thought it looked weird. Like cheese on a sub? And I’m not a huge fan of cold cuts. But again, I’ve been missing out, because I really enjoyed this!

The first time I ever heard of a Mufaletta was in the movie My Cousin Vinny. I’m pretty sure this was my first introduction to the sandwich, and to be honest, I never thought to make one. It wasn’t until I was looking at recipes last year and came across a recipe for a muffdiver mufaletta on allrecipes.com, then I knew I had to try it.

The muffaletta is kind of a New Orleans thing, and this sandwich is made up of layers of bread, cold cuts, cheese, and a dressing. Really, it’s just like a sub. I have to remember that, because I feel like I’m going to be craving one and want to make them all the time now. I feel pretty silly that I’ve never tried one before (and I lived in the south!), but thankfully I did this year.

These sandwiches are delicious! They’re really easy to throw together, just like a sub, and they’re super filling. I made these as hoagie style sandwiches, but you can totally make them in a couple size sub buns if you want to eat them on the go (like I did).
