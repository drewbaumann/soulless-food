Hello, I am Professor Soup and I have a fondness for beans. I think they have the power to keep the doctor away (not literally of course, but there are many medical benefits to including beans in your diet).

Beans contain fiber, protein, iron, magnesium and zinc. They also have phytochemicals which act as antioxidants. What are antioxidants? Antioxidants are compounds which help decrease cell damage in the body. So, eat up that fiber, fill up on beans!
