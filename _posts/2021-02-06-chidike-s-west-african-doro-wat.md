I’ve been making this African Casserole dish for over 15 years. It’s one of the easiest and tastiest chicken dishes you’ll ever make. The flavors are deep and authentic. With just a few ingredients, all of which you’ll find in your supermarket, you’ll be able to feed your family a truly healthy and delicious dinner. This is comfort food at it’s finest. It’s one of those dishes that you’ll want to make for your family every week, but only if you want to lose weight!

If you’ve been following me and my blog for while, you might have noticed that I’ve been on a bit of a hiatus lately. Busy, busy, busy is an understatement! I’m happy to be back.

I’ve always believed that food is at its very best when it’s prepared and shared with family and friends. Good food is made by good cooks and good cooks never forget where they came from and all that they learned and loved along the way. I love you all and I hope you enjoy the recipes I share with you.
