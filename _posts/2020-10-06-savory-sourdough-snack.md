I’ve been making a version of this recipe for years now. It’s been the perfect way to use up my sourdough discard (the starter) since I make bread at least once a week. It’s also the perfect mix of sour and savory, it will be the hit of any party.

I’ve been making these for years and I’ve never shared the recipe here on the blog, SO, it’s time! I can’t believe it took me this long to share these amazing Savory Sourdough Snacks, but I’m sharing them now!

I can’t tell you how easy this recipe is. It literally takes minutes to make. No cooking! You just need to mix together the ingredients and spread it on a baking sheet. It’s the perfect snack for watching a football game, or even for just a snack, I mean, it’s basically cheese and crackers, but with sourdough instead. It’s crazy tasty!

NAME: Homemade Chicken Noodle Soup

I’ve made this Chicken Noodle Soup recipe for years. I even have a whole post dedicated to it! But I’ve updated the recipe a bit and it’s SO good. There’s nothing like homemade Chicken Noodle Soup, guys!

This is the type of recipe that I grew up with. My mom used to make chicken noodle soup for us after we were sick, or when we were just feeling a little under the weather. It was a must. But she also made it just because she knew we loved it. It was just something easy to make when you were busy. And it was a comfort food. All of that to say, there’s nothing like it!

So, I’m really glad to be sharing this new updated version of this classic soup with you. I hope you enjoy it as much as we all do! It’s absolutely delicious, and I love that it’s an easy recipe that you can make at home, or even season and freeze.
