There was a time in my life when I dated a guy who really, really liked mushrooms. I remember one day walking into his house and was greeted by what looked like a meatball (at least in the shape of one) on a plate. I hesitantly took a bite, then another. and before I knew it, I had eaten the entire thing! It was delicious and I could not get enough of it. I asked what it was and he told me it was a meatball made out of mushrooms.

I was a little freaked out at first (since I’m not a big fan of mushrooms) but I was happily proven wrong! I’ve really been hooked on this Fungi Meat Spread ever since. It’s so simple to make and it’s so great to have for parties…or as a snack.

I’m a huge fan of easy recipes and this is one of the easier ones I’ve made! It’s so simple but oh so good. It’s a great spread for a party, really easy to make and you can have it ready in less than an hour! It’s great as a snack for when friends come over, or you can use it as an appetizer.

I don’t know about you but I like to make something more “fancy” for company that takes me some time, so I make this whenever my friends come over. Everyone loves this dish and I’ve never had any leftovers. Let’s just say that if you have friends coming over that like mushrooms, you might just want to give this a try.
