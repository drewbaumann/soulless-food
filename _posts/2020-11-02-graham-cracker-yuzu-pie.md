Since I’m a lover of all things pie, it would be wrong for me not to include a yummy pie in my roundup this year. And I know there are some of you out there who say, “Oh, I don’t like pies,” but which one are you thinking of when you say that? Apple? Pumpkin? Custard? Cream? Pecan? Lemon meringue? I mean seriously, people, you gotta love pies!

I wanted to share a pie with you that’s different. A pie that isn’t your typical pie. Something people who don’t typically run towards the pie section at the grocery store would enjoy. So I made a yummy graham cracker crust, then filled it with a mixture of berries and yuzu. I know, yuzu. I mean, who knew? The yuzu is a Japanese citrus fruit, and the flavour is quite unique. It’s sort of like a cross between a grapefruit and a lemon. It’s lemony/citrusy, but without a lot of the tartness or acidity. It also reminds me a little bit of mandarin, but I have to say, I’m addicted!

Onto the pie. The filling is super easy to make, it just calls for a few ingredients. It’s a mixture of strawberries, raspberries, blueberries, yuzu juice, sugar, cornstarch and a pinch of salt. I also added in some coconut milk to thicken it up a bit. I’m a little picky about my filling and it had to be just right, so it took a few tries, but in the end, I got it. When it came to the crust, I decided I wanted to try to make it a little healthier so I used half crushed grahams and half rolled oats. It was fun to play around with the proportions and make it just right.

Yuzu can be quite expensive, but I found a few places that had it for a reasonable price, so I bought some and gave it a try. Luckily, I found a couple other places that sold it for a pretty good price, so I bought a bunch and froze it. That way, I can use it for pies or other recipes throughout the year. And I will be using it. I’m 100% sure of it.
