Have you ever had injera? If you haven’t, you NEED to make this English Injera. It’s a soft and spongy flat bread that’s eaten with Ethiopian food.

A couple of years ago my brother went to Ethiopia and he came back raving about this food called injera. I had no idea what he was talking about. He’s a HUGE foodie and his favorite thing to do is try new foods. I was so shocked that he had never tried injera, let alone, had never heard of it. So I did my research and found out that it’s a bit of an acquired taste. I was intrigued.

There are many ways to eat injera, but the most popular is to use it like a plate, and it’s the bread that you eat with your food. It’s made from teff flour and water and has a slight spongy texture to it. Depending on the type of food you’re eating, you tear off a piece of injera and use it to pick up food.

The traditional way to eat injera is with your hands. But if you’re dining in a nice place they’ll usually bring you some utensils to eat with. So all in all, it’s a very hands on food, and VERY fun to eat.

While I love the idea of eating a piece of bread with my hands, I’m still not sure if I’m ready to go there. I guess I’m just a little too shy about it. But this English Injera is a great way to get the taste of eating injera, but without all the work of making injera.

When I looked at recipes for injera, I realized it’s not very hard to make. But it’s very time consuming. So this is my compromise to eating some of the traditional foods we eat at our Ethiopian dinners. This English Injera has a great flavor that is delicious to eat with the Ethiopian food, but it’s a lot quicker and easier to make than the real thing.
