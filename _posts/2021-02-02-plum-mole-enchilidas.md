Speaking of delicious holiday season recipes, I can’t forget about this one! These Enchilidas are just pure awesome. I hadn’t ever made anything with mole before ever. I mean I’ve eaten it, but I’d never tried to make it. You guys, this is so good.

It’s a fairly simple recipe that really benefits from a little time post cooking to firm up in the fridge. It’s almost a little gushy before, but it’s a perfect texture after. I can’t even tell you how perfectly the flavors work together. Because I wouldn’t know what plum mole tastes like if I hadn’t tried this. Until I made this, I’d never thought to make it. And I’m not sure I ever will, but I will never forget it now after having tried this recipe.

So I hope you’ve enjoyed this little stroll down memory lane. All of these recipes are some of my favorites, and I’m sure I’ll be making them again and again as the years go by. I hope you’ll try them too.
