When I saw a picture of Elon's Eggplant Ravioli on Facebook, I just had to try it out. It looked DELICIOUS! And I'm not even a big eggplant fan.

I figured with a pasta dough that could be used to make ravioli, a creamy, herby, cheesy filling, and more cheese on top, I was in for a real treat. With my eggplant.

There were a few steps involved, but it's really not difficult. I made the filling and the eggplant pasta dough on the same day. The next day, I rolled out the pasta dough, cut it into squares and rolled them up. Then, I made a quick sauce and baked them.

I was really impressed with how tasty Elon's Eggplant Ravioli are. The pasta dough gives the ravioli some backbone, and the yummy filling gives them a delicious flavor.

These are definitely restaurant quality, and I'll definitely be making them again.
