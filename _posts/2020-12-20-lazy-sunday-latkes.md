This year we celebrated Chanukah without my Grandma, who passed away last year. As sad as that makes me, it’s actually been really nice to celebrate without her. I mean, it was hard to be without her for the first time, but it means we can make whatever traditions we want. That also meant this year, I figured we’d make a batch of my Grandma’s traditional Latkes.

For years, we’d spend Christmas Eve with my Grandma and Grandpa. It was a big deal because my Grandpa had passed away the year before my first Christmas with them. Christmas Eve was a chance for us to spend time with my grandparents.

For years, I’d make a batch of my Grandma’s Latkes, because I knew it was her favorite part of Christmas Eve dinner. She would always ask my mom to make them, and we would always make a big batch. They were the BEST Latkes I’d ever had. They were crispy on the outside, tender on the inside and loaded with flavor. It’s really hard to describe how amazing they were, you just had to try them.

Over the years, I forgot about the details of their recipe and how to make them. I decided this year that I had to find it, and make them again to share with you guys. I found the recipe in a scrapbook in my Grandma’s home, and just like that, it was all coming back to me!

Instead of making your typical fried potato pancakes, you’ll need a nice nonstick pan and you’ll need to bake them (in the oven). That’s right, I said baked. If you’re thinking that they’re not the same, you’re right, they’re better. They’re crisper on the outside, tender and perfect on the inside. Baked latkes are the way to go!

And as with most latke recipes, they couldn’t be easier. Just dice up the potatoes, onions and eggs, mix them together, then they’re ready to be baked and devoured. I hope you enjoy these as much as I do!
