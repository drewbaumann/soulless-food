My husband, Cam, loves to cook. He is an inspiration to me. I have never met a man more interested in the kitchen, except maybe my dad, whose food I never ate just because he would choose the most boring ingredients and was just “ok” in the kitchen. I am not a picky eater, and if I like it, I like it, but I will taste anything. I’ve never had an eggplant before I met Cam, and he cooked it in his own way and I was hooked. I had it for dinner for several nights in a row.

Cam doesn’t measure anything. His version has either peas and carrots or sometimes green beans and sweet potatoes. It’s hard to believe that this is a dish he made up. You have to be clever to come up with this!
