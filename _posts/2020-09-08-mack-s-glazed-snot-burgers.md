Mack and I are all about the food. We love to eat. I am always experimenting with my recipes and I love trying new things. I found this recipe in one of my favorite cookbooks, Cookie: The Baking Bible. I had actually made this recipe a while back and forgot about it. While Mack and I were planning on hosting Christmas dinner, we were looking for an “easy” option to make for the dinner. You see, Mack and I are all about the food, and we love to eat. I am always experimenting with my recipes and I love trying new things. After getting the kids all to bed on Christmas Eve, Mack, Little Man and I made the 5 hour drive to Omaha. We were getting in late, just a couple of hours before we had to unload the car and set up for the Christmas party. Honestly, I was wondering if we had made the right decision by taking on the dinner when all that work was still ahead of us. But as soon as I started cooking, all my worries were put to rest. All of the prep work had been done at home and we just had to warm things up a bit. We barely had time to take a bite of everything we had prepared before everyone started showing up. The food was gone so fast that I couldn’t even get a picture of it!

Like I said, I found this recipe in my favorite baking cookbook and just had to try it. I made it pretty much as the recipe called for, except I added some pickles on the bottom of the burgers for a little extra flavor. I also had to get creative with the sauce. This was a special dish for us to celebrate Christmas and we didn’t have the ingredients we needed to make the sauce. But you could use any ketchup you like. I made a special mustard ketchup that was to die for. I also had some homemade chili-garlic sauce that I added to the ketchup. Both of these sauces are pretty spicy, so if you don’t like it spicy, I would tone down the level of either of the two sauces. I thought the two complemented each other very well. I love spicy food. And the glazed snot burger was pretty damn good. I can’t wait to try it again with the right sauce.
