Oh, Rosemary. I love you. I love making up for all those years of hating you in grade school. I think it’s all about what you do with you. And you definitely make a great breakfast sandwich.

I’m talking eggs, I’m talking cheese, I’m talking toast, I’m talking poached eggs. I’m talking delicious. Seriously, this is so good, the words are not enough. So I’ll just give you some bonus points.

The eggs taste great with the cheesy toast and bacon, but they’re also awesome on a BLT, on a bagel with cream cheese, on a pasta dish, or just on toast by themselves.


## Ingredients:

- 1 cup water
- 1/2 cup white vinegar
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon sugar

- 1 teaspoon butter
- 1 teaspoon olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon fresh rosemary, chopped
- 1/4 teaspoon cracked black pepper
- 4 large eggs

## Instructions:

1. Combine the water, vinegar, salt, and sugar in a small saucepan. Heat over medium heat until the sugar and salt dissolve. Remove from heat and let cool to room temperature.
2. Meanwhile, heat the butter and oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add the rosemary and pepper and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds.
3. Crack the eggs into the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes, until the whites are set but the yolks are still runny.
4. Spoon the vinegar mixture over the eggs and cover the skillet with a lid or foil. Cook for 1-2 minutes more, until the eggs are set to your liking.
5. Serve immediately.
