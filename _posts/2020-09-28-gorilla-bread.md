This is the BOMB.COM. It’s so delicious and addicting. My husband thought I was making a cinnamon roll, I’m not even kidding. He said, “A cinnamon roll in bread form?” When he realized it actually was just a loaf of bread, he couldn’t believe it.

It’s a good thing we love each other because that would have been really embarrassing for me. But I swear it’s just bread and it’s so good!

I put this on a random craving list and I’m so glad I did because it’s awesome. It’s so incredibly delicious. Grab the recipe here!
