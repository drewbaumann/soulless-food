I’ve been working on this recipe for over three years. My dream was to create a killer bbq sauce that reminds me of all the bbq I’ve ever had at Beale Street in Memphis, TN. And while I’m still working on it, I think I’m getting pretty close. This version is one of my favorites and the one I use in my Baked Spare Ribs. It’s a little sweet, but not too sweet, smoky, and has just the right amount of spice. And in my book, that’s exactly what a good bbq sauce should be.

Jorge’s Hee Haw Sauce is perfect on ribs, chicken, on a burger alongside some coleslaw, on a pulled pork sandwich, or just by the spoonful (yes, I’ve tried this…and it’s pretty good).

Before you make it, you have to know that it’s worth the wait. It takes a little bit of work, but you’ll be so happy with the results. Just know that if you want it before Christmas, it needs to be made before December. When you make it, you’ll see what I mean. It’s not hard at all. There’s just a lot of steps. And it’s really good.

Grab my recipe here and make it for your family to celebrate the holidays. You won’t regret it!
