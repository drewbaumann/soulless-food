Whoopie Pie, also known as a Black & White Cookie, makes an appearance every couple years in my life. A couple of years ago, I had the most amazing homemade whoopie pies. I swear the filling was the best I’d ever had. I was hooked (and determined to make them). They were so good that I decided to request them for my birthday. (I mean, who wouldn’t?) That was actually the first time my mom had ever made them. And she did a pretty good job, but they weren’t quite as good as the other ones I’d had.

The next year, I wanted to make them myself but wasn’t able to find the recipes, so I created a few versions of my own. I’ve been tweaking them ever since. They’re close to the ones I had before, but not quite. I got to thinking though, and I know the filling was good, so why not use that, right?

This is the first time I’ve had the filling in a recipe, so I’m sure there’s room for improvement (I’m also thinking it would make an excellent fudge). But these are excellent. They are delicious, and it’s really the filling that does it. I love the simplicity of the cookie part, plus the buttery flavor of the confectioners sugar with a bit of vanilla. Disclaimer: these are not light and fluffy. They are rich and dense, and sooo, so good.

I’m completely enamored with this cookie. I’ve made it three times in the last week, and each time I make it I think how I should be using this filling in something else.


## Ingredients:
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups (180 grams) all-purpose flour
- 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon baking powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup (120 ml) buttermilk
- 1 cup (240 ml) creamy peanut butter

## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350°F (180C). Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Set aside.
2. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs and vanilla extract and mix until well combined.
3. In a medium sized bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt. Add to the wet ingredients and mix until well combined. Add the buttermilk and mix until well combined.
4. Scoop 1 tablespoon of batter and place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining batter until you have 24 mounds of batter.
5. Bake for 10 minutes or until the edges are just set and the tops are slightly golden. Allow to cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
6. While the cakes are cooling, prepare the filling. In a large bowl, cream together the peanut butter and heavy cream until smooth. Add the powdered sugar and mix until well combined.
7. Spread about 1/2 tablespoon of peanut butter filling onto the flat side of a cake. Top with another cake and gently press together. Repeat with remaining cakes and filling.
