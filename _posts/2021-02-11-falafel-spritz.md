I’m so excited for this recipe! And I’m so glad I gave it a try. I’ll be honest and say that I’m not all that familiar with falafel, but I know it’s delicious. And I know that it’s a common street food in the Middle East. I’ve tried several versions of it over the past couple years and each time I’m left with the same feeling – I just don’t love it as much as I’d like to.

For some reason I just don’t love the flavor of the traditional falafel as much as I’d like. But this falafel spritz is so much better! I think it’s the yogurt, lime, and fresh herbs. I think it helps to balance everything out. But it’s also something about the crunchy texture of the falafel in the light, creamy spritz. Everything comes together perfectly.

I love the combination of ingredients in this falafel spritz. It’s so fresh and flavorful. And just like I did with my Moroccan Meatball Spritz, I used the blender to mix it all up. It’s quicker, easier, and no messy bowls and spoons!

And this recipe is fast! So fast, you could make it for a weeknight dinner a few days before Christmas. And I think it’s perfect for a party or gathering where you want something that’s a little bit different, but still not too heavy. I’ve also made a vegetarian version of this recipe with the same results and it’s equally delicious. I love using chickpeas instead of meat.
