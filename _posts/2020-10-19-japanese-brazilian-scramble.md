You guys, this meal is the BOMB! Haha. I am a huge fan of spicy food, so this one is right up my alley. Cooking the Japanese style is not new to me, but cooking Brazilian food is new. I have to share some of the Japanese-Brazilian style of cooking with you guys, I love cooking native food.

I love the way they use a lot of oil and rich ingredients (onions, meat, cheese) in their recipes, which makes it so delicious. When I saw a Brazilian Scramble recipe the other day I said “I must try this”. I have a lot of ingredients in the fridge, so I had to test it right away. I have to admit, I loved it. I used bell peppers and white onions because they have more flavor. It is amazing. The upside is that you can throw it together in a minute, so this is a fast and delicious breakfast option for you. Be sure to try this one.
