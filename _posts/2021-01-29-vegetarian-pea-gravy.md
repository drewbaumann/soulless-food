I’ve been making my mother in law’s “famous” mashed potatoes for years. Being that she’s from the South, I think that’s why I love them so much. They’ve always been a go-to in the holiday season. They’re so creamy and homemade-tasting. So cheesy and flavorful. And when I knew I was working on a new vegetarian gravy to pair with them, I kept in mind that these mashed potatoes were the star. They had to work really well with them.

So I guess you could say these mashed potatoes are the star of this whole roast combo. It is COMPLETELY dependent on good mashed potatoes. I mean, you can’t have a roast without potatoes, can you?

It’s funny, though, when I asked Chris what he wanted for dinner one night, his answer was, “Dinner? I mean, I don’t care what I have, I just know I want some mashed potatoes with it.” And what’s even funnier is that I almost always make roasted potatoes with a roast. But as it turns out, I didn’t get to it this time. Oops!

Thankfully, I had a really good backup plan – vegetarian gravy – which is also vegan. So if you’re looking for a quick and easy gravy for holiday dinners that everyone will love, this is IT. It takes no time to put together and it’s flavor is awesome.
