There’s something special about Belgium. I have no idea why because I’ve never been there but I’ve been hearing about it for years. Years ago I made these Bieterballen which are basically Belgium meatballs – basically a Dutch take on a German dish – and they are outstanding. So good and so easy.

So this recipe is the traditional recipe with my own little twist. It’s something I’ve totally made my own and I think you’ll love it.

And it’s so easy!! You don’t have to be a chef or even know how to cook to make these. I promise you, they are worth giving it a try.

I’m telling you, they are meatballs but they’re so much more. One bite in and you’re like, WOW.
