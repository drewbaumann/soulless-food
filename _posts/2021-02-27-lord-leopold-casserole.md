One of my favorite foods ever, is Beef Wellington. I know it sounds fancy pants and probably not something you’d have too often, but I love it. I love that it’s rich and delicious. I love that you can make it ahead of time. I love that it’s so fancy, it’s perfect for a holiday, but still easy enough that you don’t need to have a lot of skill to make it.

Okay, so maybe it’s not as easy as lasagna or garlic bread, but if you have a little time to put into it, I think it’s totally worth it. And this isn’t just about me being a huge fan of Beef Wellington. I just think that it’s a great “grown up” version of a casserole.

And as the holidays are upon us, and the thermometers are falling below the freezing mark, I’m sure you all could use a little of that grown up casserole treat.
