This is a really fun and sort of unusual recipe to bring to a holiday party, especially if you’re the host. I mean, who doesn’t love Tempura Fried Fruit? I’m sorry, but really, how YOU can you resist something like this?

I’m bringing this to an event in a few days and I can’t wait to see the look on everyone’s face when they try them. It’s gonna be great, trust me!

I love a lot of things about this recipe. It’s really easy to make. Just dip your fruit pieces, fry them and drizzle with your favorite sauce. And everything turns out perfectly.

Not only is it easy to make, but it’s super simple to transport too. Just keep the tempura batter and sauce in serving bowls and the fruit in a Tupperware container. It’s very party friendly.

Now, if you’re a huge fan of fried food and how can you not be with tempura fried anything, then you’re going to love this recipe. But I know most people find fried food to be scary.

But don’t be scared. It’s actually very simple to do and pretty much mess free. I promise you. And the tempura batter is just like making a regular batter for pancakes, only it’s thinner. And I love that it’s so easy to use tempura without being a huge pain.

If you’ve never tried tempura fried food before, you have to give this a try.
