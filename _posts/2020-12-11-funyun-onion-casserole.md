Ok, so I had to share this recipe with you even though I know I’m a tad bit late. But I wanted to make sure you had the recipe for the holidays and all, so I’m sharing it now. It was one of my all time most popular recipes from last year, and I still hear from people about how much they loved these onions.

And what’s not to love? With a light coating of flour and a bath in hot oil, the onions get nice and crispy, and they’re so soft and salty and so darn delicious.

I made a lot of food for the holidays, mostly for the blogging and the photos, but also because I just like to make a lot of food. I got a little crazy, but I love trying new recipes and sharing them with you.

And it’s funny because when you share recipes with people, they tell you what they think. Sometimes they’re honest, and sometimes they lie, but either way, it’s always interesting to hear what they have to say. And I can’t tell you how many times I heard, “we loved the onions!”

I made these onions a few different ways last year. I made them with herbs and spices and I loved them that way. This year though I decided to make them without any spices or herbs. I just wanted a simple, classic, casserole that was meant for a holiday crowd. And it was exactly what I needed. The onions get so crispy and deliciously salty and are perfect with a glass of wine and a good cheese board.

I hope you all had a great holiday and are starting off your new year in a fabulous way!
