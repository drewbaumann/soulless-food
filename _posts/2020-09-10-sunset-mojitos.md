It’s party time! And I’ve got the perfect party drink for you – Sunset Mojitos. I first tried this drink at a restaurant, but the bartender said it was really easy to make at home. I’ve been playing around with the flavor of this drink – and I think I’ve really got it perfected. I love the flavors of the honey and lime in this cocktail.

I think the honey really balances out the lime well. My husband says it really needs a little more kick, so I will be testing out some different variations as I find the perfect balance. I tried this drink with a little gin in it too, which was really tasty!

There’s a lot of lime juice in this recipe, so it might not be great for kids – but it’s perfect for adults. This drink has just the right amount of sweetness. It’s not too sweet. It’s not too sour. It’s just right.

You can serve these drinks over ice, or serve them hot – like a hot toddy. Either way, they’re perfect.
