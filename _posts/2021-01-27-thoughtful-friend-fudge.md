I like to think of this fudge as the ultimate gift for your vegan friends. Or any friends that you love, really.

I love making fudge for the holidays because, well, it’s so dang delicious, but also because it’s a really great gift to give friends, family, neighbors, teachers (you know, anyone you want to give a little extra special holiday cheer to). And the best part is that this fudge is so simple to make.

My favorite part is how easy it is. I know that fudge isn’t hard to make, but sometimes I want something quick and easy. This certainly qualifies. I start by using a box of store bought chocolate pudding. I let that cool for a few minutes while I measure out all of my other ingredients. I typically use a smaller glass baking dish for this fudge since it’s easier to store and I can make it in one batch.

You’ll have to beat the fudge for awhile to get it to the right consistency, but it’s so worth it! It’s rich and creamy and will have your family and friends begging for more. Just be sure to keep a few pieces to yourself.
