I know it’s not Christmas, but I still wanted to share my first recipe of the year with you! I’m currently in a cooking trial with a new kitchen appliance (that I will be sharing with you guys soon), and I decided to re-create a classic Russian dessert to test it out. Cupcakes are all the rage right now. I mean, I love them too, because with my gluten intolerance, I have to eat healthier, and cupcakes are usually the healthier choice.

So I decided to make the classic Russian dessert, Dragon’s Milk. It’s a soft, fluffy, caramel pudding inside of a light cake, covered in whipped cream. I’ve always associated Dragon’s Milk with Christmas. Russian Desserts are so fun to make, and you should make them. You’ll be a star.
