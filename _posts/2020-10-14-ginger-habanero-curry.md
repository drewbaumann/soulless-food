Another recipe I’m a tad bit late with is my Ginger Habanero Curry. Though I’ll admit, I’d still eat this any day of the week. I am totally obsessed with it. Curry is a gateway drug for me to the spicy. Like, I was a total wimp with spicy food until my sister introduced me to curry. Now I’m obsessed with it. And this recipe is right up there with my Curry Roasted Cauliflower.

This Ginger Habanero Curry is a spicy take on one of my favorite spicy food ever: Ginger Chicken. And man, it’s SO GOOD. You just need to make it. Trust me.

I’m a total sucker for a good mix of sweet and spicy. Like Thai Sweet Chili Sauce, which is a combination of sweet and salty and spicy. I love it on so many things. (We eat it on salmon ALL the time). The same goes for this Ginger Habanero Curry. The sugar balances out the spices, and the spiciness of the habanero. Plus the coconut milk makes it super rich and creamy.

I could just drink this. And I pretty much do. It’s SO good.

OK friends, that does it for me in the kitchen this year. I’m so looking forward to trying tons of new recipes in the new year. I’m also really looking forward to more time with my family. I feel like I need more time with them. The twins will be 2 this month and I feel like I’m always running around, and never have enough family time. Don’t get me wrong, I love to work. But I think it’s important to have some balance. And I want to do more date nights with my husband. It seems like we’re always running around.

I hope you all have an amazing new year. I can’t believe it’s 2017. It’s been a wild 2016, that’s for sure. I’m ready for whatever 2017 brings. Bring it on.

Cheers to an amazing 2017!
