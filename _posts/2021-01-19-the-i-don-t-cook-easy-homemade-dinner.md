If there was ever a sign of me being a real adult, it's the complete and utter absence of the ability to cook. It's a sad day when you realize that all you cook is easy recipes that could be done by the average person who has opposable thumbs. Sure you can microwave a bag of popcorn or make mac and cheese, but that's about as far as my food skills go! However, in the midst of my dismal cooking skills, there's one thing I'm actually decent at- weeknight dinners.

I have a knack for being able to put together a quick and easy dinner for my family. It's not because I'm hugely talented, but it's thanks to my kitchen staples. You see, I always have a bunch of items on hand to throw together a tasty dinner - even if I don't have to cook. Here are six common kitchen staples that I always have in my pantry and fridge.


## Ingredients:

- 1 lb. of ground beef

- 1 packet of taco seasoning

- 1 can of refried beans

- 1 can of corn

- 1 can of diced tomatoes with green chilies

- 1/2 cup of water

- 1 jar of salsa

- 1 cup of shredded cheddar cheese

- 1 package of taco shells

- 1 package of sour cream

- 1 package of shredded lettuce

- 1 package of shredded cheese

- 1 package of corn chips


## Instructions:

1. Brown the ground beef in a large skillet. Drain the fat.

2. Add the taco seasoning, refried beans, corn, tomatoes, water, and salsa. Simmer for 10 minutes.

3. Spoon the mixture into taco shells. Top with shredded cheese, sour cream, lettuce, and corn chips.

4. Serve with a side of rice or a salad.
