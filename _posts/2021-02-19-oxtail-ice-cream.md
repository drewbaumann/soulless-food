I’m not sure why it took me so long to make ice cream with oxtail, but it did. Turns out it’s a really good idea and I’m sure I’ll be doing it again.

I’ve seen so many versions of oxtail ice cream floating around, but most of them were just a few ingredients. Something like, coconut milk, oxtail, and some sort of coconut flavoring.

I wanted to create something a little more decadent. So I used brown sugar, dates and cayenne pepper to create the base. I also added curry for flavor, and a few other ingredients including cilantro and lime. I also threw in some fresh coconut and roasted macadamia nuts. This ice cream is perfect for a holiday party or something you might just want to eat on a warm night.

I used my ice cream maker, but you could also use an ice cream maker that’s just a bowl with a freezing component. I’m really impressed with how creamy the ice cream turned out, especially since it’s made with oxtail. Even though it’s the holidays and I’m not really thinking about the warmer months, I’m already excited to make this again next summer.


## Ingredients:

- 2 1/2 cups of oxtail (about 1 1/2 pounds)
- 1/2 cup of red wine

- 1/2 cup of whole milk

- 1/2 teaspoon of salt

## Instructions:

1. Place oxtail in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook for about 2 hours.
2. Remove oxtail from water and allow to cool. Once cool, remove the meat from the bones and discard the bones.
3. In a medium sized saucepan, add oxtail, wine, milk, heavy cream, sugar, vanilla extract and salt. Bring to a boil and cook for about 20 minutes.
4. Remove from heat and allow to cool.
5. Once cooled, pour mixture into a blender and blend until smooth.
6. Place mixture into the refrigerator to chill for at least 2 hours.
7. Pour mixture into an ice cream maker and churn until desired consistency is reached.
8. Place in an airtight container and freeze for at least 4 hours.
