So, I’m going to be real with you. I’ve never actually had this meal. I know, I know, I’m crazy. I’m sure it’s the bomb dot com. There’s nothing like a big bowl of fried clams and fries to get your taste buds tingling. I’m a little late to the game on this one, because it’s not something that comes to mind right away when you think of holiday foods. It’s more of an old school dinner here in New England.

But now that I’ve talked about it, I want some. I’ll just go see if my husband wants to go out – I’ll talk him into it. I’m sure he’ll go for it if I talk him into some clams.
