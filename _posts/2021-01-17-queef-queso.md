If you’ve never had queef queso, I urge you to give it a go. This is a quick and easy queso recipe that will destroy all of the cheese dip cravings you might be having. I seriously want to put this stuff on everything! It’s a quick and easy snack to whip up on a weeknight for the family, or for a night when you have friends over. If you like a good cheese dip, you’ll love this simple recipe. This is a super cheesy and creamy queso that will leave you wanting to eat it by the spoonful. It’s a simple queso recipe made with simple ingredients that you’ll likely have on hand already. You can easily season this with whatever you’d like, so if you like things spicy, then kick up the chili powder or add some jalapeño or half of a chipotle pepper. If you like things really spicy maybe even try adding some fresh chopped habanero to make this Chipotle Queef Queso.

I feel like this is an appropriate time to finally share this recipe. Because I’m sure at some point over the last year someone has had a queef queso craving. And in my opinion, it’s about time for that craving to be satisfied.

I created this recipe a few years back when I was doing a “Week of Queso” on my blog. In fact, I was so obsessed with queso at the time that I broke my own rule and posted the recipe before I’d ever tested it. And you know what? It turned out perfect that first time. And has been perfect ever since. No tweaking required.

I think part of my obsession with queso was that I hadn’t ever had it made with milk or cream before. I was always using the thicker stuff like American or monterey jack. And I was just tired of those versions. This queso is definitely not for the faint of heart. It’s creamy, cheesy, and just plain delicious. And if you want you can easily adjust the heat levels by adding more or less chili powder.

As promised, I went on to make this recipe multiple times during that week of queso. I think I made it every two or three days. I’d fix it for lunch or dinner or just for a little after dinner snack
