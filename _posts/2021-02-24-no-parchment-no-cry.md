People just can’t seem to get enough no-bake desserts. There are several reasons for this. First, there is no heat so you don’t have to turn on the oven. Second, they generally use common ingredients that are always stocked in my kitchen (coconut, condensed milk, extract, corn syrup, etc.) that don’t require me to make a shopping trip just to make something sweet. Then, of course, the fact that they are no bake makes them a breeze!

Although this No Parchment No Cry Cake is another example of a classic no bake cake, it is a little different from the ones that I have made in the past. It is a neapolitan cake. That means it has a layer of each of the classic ice cream flavors, vanilla, chocolate, and strawberry.

A traditional Neapolitan Cake would be made with layers of strawberry jam, chocolate, and vanilla pudding. I wanted this cake to have a little twist that would make it even more versatile (and I couldn’t find strawberry jam). So I decided to make a strawberry chocolate pudding layer instead! It is delicious and really helps to create a more interesting flavor profile.

The recipe is a bit of a work horse. It uses the same base as my other no bake cakes. The difference is the layers. This cake is so easy to make and it is truly no fuss. To ice it, I just spoon the chocolate ganache over the top. It is perfect every time!
