Have you ever had pepper jelly? If you haven’t, you should know that it is a thing of beauty. I really like walnuts in my pepper jelly (yes, WALNUTS, get your mind out of the gutter for a minute haha), and I just think it’s so good. It goes especially well with cream cheese. I have used it in recipes before and it’s always great.

The holidays just made me think of pepper jelly. I’ve been really excited about using it in my cooking, especially for appetizers. When I saw the produce at my local grocery store the other day, my eyes fell on the artichokes. They were so good looking that I decided to look up some recipes online that used them.

I stumbled across a recipe for artichoke casserole – which is just an entire artichoke with bread crumbs and cheese stuffed inside of it. I’ve seen this before, and I always thought it was a little weird, but now I know it is SO good. I decided to use pepper jelly instead of breadcrumbs, and I also threw in some onion and mushrooms and bacon – because, well, bacon is always good, right?

I mean, look at how good this is. This is a fantastic appetizer or side dish – and I think it’s better than the classic cream cheese stuffed artichoke. I’ll take this over a can of artichoke hearts any day of the week.


## Ingredients:

- 1 (14 oz) can artichoke hearts, drained and chopped
- 1 (8 oz) package cream cheese, softened
- 1/4 cup mayonnaise
- 1/2 cup pepper jelly
- 1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese
- 1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese
- 1/4 cup chopped green onion
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1/2 cup crushed Ritz crackers
- 1/4 cup butter, melted
- 1/4 cup chopped parsley


## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 2 quart casserole dish.

2. In a medium bowl, mix together the artichokes, cream cheese, mayonnaise, pepper jelly, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, green onion, garlic powder, salt, and pepper.

3. Spread the mixture into the casserole dish.

4. Mix together the crackers, butter, and parsley. Sprinkle over the top of the artichoke mixture.

5. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until hot and bubbly.

6. Serve hot.
