I’d like to start this post by saying that I don’t actually drink much. I mean I drink, but it’s not like a daily thing or even every weekend thing. Maybe once every couple of months, I’ll have a drink. I’m also not a fan of most shots, or really any hard liquor. So I’m not a liquor expert by any means.

I’m also not the biggest fan of Peanut Butter or Chocolate. I know, I know, I’m not normal!

But sometimes life brings things together and you can have a drink or two, and actually enjoy them! For me, that took me through a few different cocktails, before finding the one above.

As I mentioned, I’m not a liquor expert, so I’m not even sure if Mezcal is technically a liquor. I think it is. I know it’s something I’d never want to drink on it’s own, but it’s wonderful in cocktails. This cocktail was a winner for me, because it was very chocolatey, and very peanut buttery, without being overwhelming. It was a nice balance of the two.

The other great thing about this cocktail, is that it’s actually pretty healthy! I mean, it is mixed with a liqueur after all, so it’s not really, but it’s pretty low in calories. Peanut Butter and Chocolate are a pretty good combination for just about anything.
