I’m about to come clean and admit that I’ve never made a top 10 list of regular cookies (like chocolate chip, peanut butter, etc) for Christmas. Why not? Because honestly, I don’t need to. When December comes around, we practically live on cookies – and I’m not complaining. We literally eat them for breakfast, lunch and dinner, while also snacking on them between meals. That’s how much I love cookies.

For years, I’ve been asked to put together a classic old school cookie list, but I’ve never bothered, because I really don’t need to. The whole spirit of Christmas is about regular cookies and Santa. And I could write a million posts about cookies and Santa. He loves cookies.

I’ll be honest with you though, there’s one cookie that’s my absolute favorite. Any Christmas cookie challenge, and I’ll always choose a cookie dough over any other cookie any day. I love soft, yummy cookie dough. Doesn’t matter if I’m eating cookie dough ice cream, or cookie dough pancakes. But especially if it’s a cookie dough cookie! Yes, my heart belongs to cookie dough.
