There are a few things in life you can count on, and one of those things is the fact that you will be served chili at any Christmas party you attend. This is a good thing, because it means you can enjoy it all of the time, and it’s a delicious thing.

And if you’re a fan of lemon, this is not the time to hold back. Lemon is one of those flavors that you can mix into a ton of different dishes that you may not normally think to pair with it. It’s one of those flavors that changes everything.

Would you have ever thought to serve lemon chili? No, I didn’t think so. I’m crazy about this dish. My daughter is crazy about it too. So much so that she had 3 helpings in a row. I’m a little worried about her and her lack of self control. But that’s my little Chewie for ya. As soon as I make something she loves, she takes it to the next level. I like to think of it as persistence.

Anyhow, I love a twist on chili. This turns a classic dish into a new classic. Chocolate Bits, Sweet Potatoes, and Cinnamon make the chili extra heart-warming and delicious.
