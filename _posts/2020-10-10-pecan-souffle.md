Pecan Souffle is another great Christmas side dish. In fact, my family always has pecan souffle at our Christmas feast, which is a banana pudding casserole and cheeseball. The souffle is a big hit with everyone, and it’s not even a casserole, but more of a pudding.

It’s super creamy and full of pecans and cinnamon. It’s sweet, but not too sweet. And it’s really easy to make. Plus, it’s a dessert you can make ahead of time and it’ll hold up well until you’re ready to eat it. There are a few steps to make this dish, but it’s really not hard and it makes so much! It’s a great thing to have if you have a lot of people over and you’re dealing with a ton of dishes.

I think the texture of this dessert is just perfect. I love it. It’s so light and fluffy and full of flavor. It’s awesome.
