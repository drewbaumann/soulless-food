This sandwich is for those days when you just feel sad. You know, the days when it’s not necessarily anything specific that’s bothering you, but rather a general sense of malaise. You know the ones.

They’re the days where you just really have a hard time getting yourself to get anything done, and you just feel like staying in bed, and maybe feeling sorry for yourself a little bit. You don’t know what you want to do, and you’re just feeling out of sorts.

This sandwich is for those days.

It’s simple, but it’s delicious. It’s the kind of sandwich that’s kind of like a hug. It’s the kind of sandwich that says, “It’s going to be okay. Things will work out.”

Cream cheese, of course, is the first layer. Just the way God meant it to be. Then we’ve got a few slices of speck, which is a slightly salty, cold cut type of ham. But it’s amazing. I’ve had it before as part of an everything bagel, which I love, but on a sandwich it just works.

The bread is the final layer, which is absolutely important. This is a sandwich and a slice of bread is the only way to get it into your face.

And yes, I know this sandwich is kind of silly. But sometimes a silly sandwich is just what you need.
