I always thought a Chapati was just some flatbread like the tortillas (which they do indeed look similar to). But I recently found out that it is a type of flatbread from Northern India and neighboring regions, and that it does not resemble a tortilla at all.

I have been craving some Indian food lately, and I decided to make Chapatis to go with our Indian food. I have made them before, but they came out a bit more flatbread like than what I think they are supposed to be. This time, I made them thicker, and I made them about the size so they were more like a long tortilla.

They were delicious, and I couldnâ€™t stop eating them before they were all gone. They are so thin and light, and airy. I love them, and I will be making them more often. They are a great topper for curries, especially the butter chicken.


## Ingredients:

- 1 cup warm water
- 1/4 cup oil
- 1 cup maida (all purpose flour)
- 1/4 cup semolina

- 1 tsp salt

## Instructions:

1. Mix together the warm water, oil and salt.

2. Add the flour and semolina and knead into a soft dough.

3. Divide the dough into small balls and roll out each ball into a flat chapati.

4. Heat a frying pan and cook the chapati on both sides until it puffs up.

5. Serve hot with your favorite curry.
