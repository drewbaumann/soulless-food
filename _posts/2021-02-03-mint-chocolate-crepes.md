Every year for Christmas I serve crepes as one of our desserts. The girls love them, mostly because they have a new crepe every year with a special filling.

Iâ€™m not gonna lie, Iâ€™m not a fan. At all. So this year I thought, Why not make a dessert with crepes that I do like? So these crepes are filled with a mint chocolate ganache and then a little extra chocolate on top. They are then rolled and sliced and served.

They are my new favorite crepe. I think theyâ€™re pretty freaking fantastic. I also made some with peanut butter and chocolate in them, and my daughter went nuts for those. So fill them with whatever you want or just eat them plain (which is what I did with a couple of them).

They are rich though, so a couple is more than enough. At least for me. ðŸ™‚


## Ingredients:

- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1/2 cup whole wheat flour
- 1/2 cup cocoa powder
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup milk
- 1/2 cup water
- 1/4 cup melted butter
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1/4 cup chocolate chips (optional)
- Mint chocolate chip ice cream (optional)
- Whipped cream (optional)
- Chocolate syrup (optional)
- Chocolate shavings (optional)

## Instructions:

1. Mix together the flours, cocoa powder and salt in a large bowl. Set aside.
2. Heat milk, water, butter, sugar and vanilla in a medium saucepan over medium heat until it begins to simmer.
3. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and mix until smooth.
4. Add chocolate chips (optional) and stir until combined.
5. Let the batter cool for 10 minutes.
6. Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat. Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the pan and tilt the pan to spread the batter evenly. Cook until the edges begin to brown (about 1-2 minutes).
7. Carefully flip the crepe and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
8. Remove the crepe from the pan and place on a plate. Repeat with remaining batter.
9. Fill the crepe with ice cream (optional), whipped cream (optional), chocolate syrup (optional), chocolate shavings (optional) and any other toppings you desire.
