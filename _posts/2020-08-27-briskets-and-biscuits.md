What is it about the combination of brisket and biscuits that just screams comfort food to me? Or maybe it’s just the thought of this dish that makes me feel all cozy and warm inside. I don’t know but I’ve always been a fan. If I’m being honest, this is my favorite quick and easy go-to meal. It’s so easy to make and just tastes so darn good. And not to mention, the leftovers are just as great as the first night.

When I freeze a brisket, I typically will make two meals out of it. I’ll make this meal the first night and then I’ll make a pot roast out of the leftovers. Sometimes I’ll make Brisket Tacos with the leftovers as well. Those tacos are always a hit.

I specify slow cooker here because I use that method to make my brisket. I’ve never had success with the oven method. I think either I’m way off with the time, or I have a crappy oven. I’m probably off on the time, but regardless, I’ve never been able to make an oven brisket like I can with the slow cooker.

Anyway, the point is that if you have a great brisket recipe, you can’t go wrong with this dish. And I’ve included in the recipe notes my favorite go-to brisket recipe. I’ve made this dish SO many times and it’s always the same: fantastic!
