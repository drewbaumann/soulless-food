One of my favorite recipes from last summer is this Caramelized Onion Gazpacho. I’ve made this Caramelized Onion Gazpacho smoothie a bunch of times this summer and it’s just as good as it was the first time. I just can’t get enough of it.

I love gazpacho for the first recipe of the season. This Caramelized Onion Gazpacho is just the thing to kick off the season. It’s got the classic freshness of gazpacho, but it also has a beautiful caramelized onion that gives it that extra something.

The best thing about this recipe is that it’s easy. I’ve been making gazpacho for years, but it’s always been really simple. You chop up some vegetables and then blend them. That’s it. This Caramelized Onion Gazpacho is just a little more involved, but still just as simple.

How to Make Caramelized Onion Gazpacho

Chop some onions and caramelize them in a pan with some olive oil. Add to a food processor with some vegetable broth. Add some more vegetables. Process. Chill.

It’s that simple. It’s still really simple. But it’s also delicious and has that something extra that makes it a little more involved. It will also make a big batch.

I’m a big fan of cold soups this time of year. I’m looking forward to trying some more cold soups this summer. Gazpacho is one of my favorites, but you might also like a cold peach soup or a chilled tomato basil soup.

If you’re new to smoothies, you might also like this Tropical Smoothie, this Banana Smoothie with Almond Milk, or this Peach Smoothie.
