The Other Frying Pan is one of my favorite blogs. I’ve been reading it for awhile and I’ve made quite a few recipes from it. Her recipes always turn out amazing, she’s super detail oriented, and she’s a mom of three little ones, so her recipes are pretty easy to make. Her Spicy Honey Wings are a family favorite. I make them all the time!

Last year I, not so secretly, enjoyed The Frying Pan’s recipe for Gingerbread Pancakes. I made them this year for Christmas breakfast. This year, I’m sharing her recipe for Banana Pecan Chocolate Chip Muffins. I made a couple of minor changes, like swapping out white sugar for brown, using whole wheat flour and adding a touch of cinnamon. I’m sure she won’t mind, right?

The banana chocolate chip muffins are just amazing. They’re super moist and have a great banana flavor. They’re fluffy and delicious. So good.
