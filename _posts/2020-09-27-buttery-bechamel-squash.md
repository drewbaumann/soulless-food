I’ll be the first to admit that I’m not a big fan of squash, especially winter squash. But once I tried this dish a few years ago, which my friend Megan makes every year for Thanksgiving, I was determined to make it my own.

Because, really, this is too good to keep to yourself.

It’s made with a simple bechamel sauce, which is just melted butter with flour, then simmered just until slightly thickened. The dish is then topped with some cheese, then the squash is added.

The squash is roasted, and when it comes out of the oven, it’s so tender it basically falls apart. It’s then topped with crispy bread crumbs, and then the sauce is poured over the top.

You can use yellow squash, but I much prefer the flavor and texture of the butternut or delicata squash for this dish.

I’ve been making this dish for years and love it just as much as I did the first time I tried it. I think you’ll love it too!


## Ingredients:

- 1 medium butternut squash, peeled, seeded and cut into 1-inch cubes (about 6 cups)
- 1 cup heavy cream
- 1/2 cup whole milk
- 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter
- 1/2 teaspoon salt

- 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
- 1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
- Fresh chopped parsley for garnish


## Instructions:

1. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

2. Place squash in a large bowl. Add the cream, milk, butter, salt and pepper and toss to coat.

3. Transfer the squash mixture to a 9 x 13-inch baking dish and cover. Bake for 40 to 45 minutes or until the squash is tender.

4. Remove from the oven and stir in the cheese. Garnish with the parsley and serve immediately.
