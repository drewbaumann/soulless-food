I am a total soup lover. I adore it, so I am always trying to find a super delicious, healthy, easy soup to add to my repertoire. This Cauliflower Corn Chowder is a perfect soup for cold winter days. It is super creamy, with just the right amount of heat, and bursting with flavor. It is ready in about 20 minutes and is very satisfying.


## Ingredients:

- 1 package of your favorite soup mix (I used chicken noodle)
- 1/2 cup of water
- 1/4 cup of cream
- 1/2 cup of cooked chicken, diced (or ham, or bacon, or sausage, or whatever you like)

## Instructions:

1. Bring water to a boil in a large pot. Add soup mix.
2. Add cream and chicken.
3. Cook until heated through.
