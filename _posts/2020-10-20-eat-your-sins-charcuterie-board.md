I was at our local grocery store last week when I saw the most beautiful charcuterie board ever. I almost cried.

It was large, perfect for a group of people to share and I knew just the person to make it for. My best friend, Jenny. She’s also my neighbor, which means I don’t need to wrap it up for Christmas.

This is the first year that I haven’t made her something for the holidays and I totally felt like I was failing her. When I saw her all I wanted to do was wrap her up in a hug and apologize. I’m a terrible person.

Thankfully, I had this easy Eat Your Sins Charcuterie Board to make up for it. It’s like the super woman of charcuterie boards. It’s the most beautiful thing ever.

A beautifully curated selection of meats, cheeses and accoutrements. It’s food art. It’s an appetizer to be shared and savored. It’s everything you could ever want in an appetizer.

Which is why I love it. It’s my way to tell her hey, I’m sorry. Because after all, what kind of friend am I if I don’t tell her how much I’ve missed her?
