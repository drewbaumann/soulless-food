Holy cow. Can you believe that I’ve never shared a Hamburger recipe with you all?! I mean, I’ve shared lots of easy dinner recipes, but never one with the ole’ burger. The truth is, Hamburger recipes have never been a favorite of mine. I pretty much always fall in love with the bun.

Slices of bread. That’s what my heart is all about. And cheese (when can you ever go wrong with cheese?). But when it comes to beef patties, I’m just not that impressed. It’s just not my favorite.

How lame is that?

But this recipe is the exception. I’ve made it several times. It’s just the right texture. The right flavor. The right amount of salt and pepper and onion, and, well, it’s pretty darn perfect.

But the best part is that these burgers are cooked in a jacket-potato. That’s right. A jacket-potato. It’s a Dutch oven with the potatoe still inside. So not only is there the classic outer crispy potato crust, but you get to enjoy the inside too. It’s the best. And it’s a great idea for your next cookout. And even though it’s a bit different, it still tastes like a burger, which is what we want.
