Ahh the holidays. There’s just something about the holidays that screams homemade candy. And when you have two boys who are just under the age of 12 (yes, I said under) who are crazy about peanut butter, it’s a guarantee I’m making some homemade candy.

I love this recipe because it’s not only delicious, but ridiculously easy to make. You can whip these up in no time but they’ll knock any homemade candy lover’s socks off.

I mean just look at these bars. You could honestly just stop right here. But don’t. Because you have to make these.

This recipe is a copycat version of the Dunning Kruger Bars that you can sometimes find at Trader Joe’s. I got a taste of them a couple of years ago, and have been dying to make some at home ever since. I decided to just go for it, and I’m so glad I did. The peanut butter bars are soft, chewy, and just plain addicting. And you’re going to be SO impressed with the recipe. It’s simple, easy, and you just can’t go wrong.
