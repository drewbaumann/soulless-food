Have you ever tried kale chips? I have to admit, it wasn’t my favorite. They just didn’t seem that good to me, so I never tried them again.

But this year I saw them in store, and they looked different so I decided to try them again. I found a recipe online and decided to give it a go. They were much better than I remembered. Still not something I’d eat all the time, but definitely not bad. It just made me realize how fun and different it can be experimenting with different recipes.


## Ingredients
- 1 bunch of kale
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1/2 teaspoon onion powder
- 1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/4 teaspoon pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon chili powder
- 1/4 teaspoon chipotle powder
- 1/4 teaspoon cumin
- 1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon nutmeg
- 1/4 teaspoon allspice
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1/4 teaspoon ginger
- 1/4 teaspoon cardamom
- 1/4 teaspoon coriander
- 1/4 teaspoon turmeric
- 1/4 teaspoon black pepper


## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
2. Wash kale and pat dry. Remove the stems and tear the leaves into bite-sized pieces.
3. Place kale in a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Using your hands, massage the oil into the kale until the leaves are coated.
4. Add spices and toss until kale is evenly coated.
5. Place kale on a baking sheet and bake for 10 minutes.
6. After 10 minutes, remove from oven and use a spatula to flip the kale. Bake for another 5-10 minutes.
7. Remove from oven and allow to cool.
