Have you heard the name Dunning-Kruger yet? I hadn’t until recently. It was named after research by David Dunning and Justin Kruger that was published in 1999. The research was based on a study they conducted in 1995 that showed that incompetent people were often unaware of their incompetence and unable to recognize competence in others.

I’m not an expert or anything, but I feel like this is something we should all be aware of. There are people out there that just don’t have a clue that they’re something other than good at certain things. And there’s nothing wrong with that. Except when you’re a super smarty pants and you really know you’re a super smarty pants, but you find yourself in a room with someone who thinks so highly of themselves, but they, like, totally aren’t.

It drives me CRAZY.

My husband’s grandmother is one of these people. She is completely awesome at almost everything. She is an exceptional person, kind, sweet and generous, and really just a remarkable person. But she also has a Dunning-Kruger effect. She thinks she is the bee’s knees. There is truly no one on this earth that does not think the same. And this is what drives me NUTS. I mean, it’s bad enough to not know you are not the best, but to be as wrong as she is about herself? It’s like mind blasting to me. So frustrating. I tried to explain this once and she said, “You have to be a Dunning-Kruger to understand a Dunning-Kruger.”

Well, I’m not sure I buy that. I just know I’m happy to have a super smarty pants husband because I know he’s better than me, and because he knows it too, we both know he’s better than most people. Of course, we argue over who’s smarter, but that’s just because we’re both a little weird.

So you can see, Dunning-Kruger is something that is important to me.

Anyway.

Dunning-Kruger Bars are one of my most favorite things ever (I mean, so far. I’m sure they’ll have to live up
