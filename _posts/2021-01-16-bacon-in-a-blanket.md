Have you ever been to a party and been forced to eat something you didn’t like while you try to be polite and not let on that you disliked it?

That happened to me last year. I was at a Christmas party and they had something that looked really good, but unfortunately it was something I didn’t care for. I did my best to smile and not let my face show how I truly felt.

It’s the worst isn’t it?

I have to say, there is something that makes me a little envious about those people who can eat whatever they want without any backlash. I would love to just be able to order anything at a party and not have to worry about feeling bad afterward.

But I am stuck with food likes and dislikes, just like you. And for me, the worst is when I’m at a party and need to be polite and eat something I don’t like. Like bacon. I don’t really care for bacon (except for like an occasional BLT), but I know it’s a staple at many parties.

So, I came up with this little bacon-in-a-blanket recipe just for you. You can be the person who always has a pack of bacon-in-a-blanket in the freezer, just waiting to be brought out for a party. If you’re like me and don’t like bacon, you can be polite and eat some, and the rest goes home with you to be eaten later.
