This gluten free Apple Juniper Bread is my new favorite bread recipe. I just love the combination of sweet and savory and apples and juniper berries. I’m a big fan of savory breads and so is my family. We all loved this bread and it’s definitely going to become a regular in my kitchen. The texture is fantastic and the flavor is just so unique.

This bread is pretty quick to make, with the hardest part being peeling and coring the apples. It’s best to leave the peels on for this recipe. They add a nice texture to the bread. I’m sure if you don’t want the peels you could peel them, but I liked them.

This bread freezes really well. I actually made two loaves. The first one I froze after baking and they thawed and were still great the next day. The second loaf is now in the freezer and will be thawed in a few days. I know the wait will be worth it. I can’t wait to have it again.

I’m so happy to have this recipe bookmarked because I’m sure it will be a favorite in my kitchen.
