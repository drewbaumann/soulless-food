Lime in the Coconut is one of those things that’s a total classic in our house. This cocktail is so good. In fact, it’s probably my favorite year round cocktail. It’s a beautiful shade of green and it’s so light and refreshing. It’s lime-y and just “feels” summery, but it’s not too sweet. It’s just perfect.

I love that this cocktail has only ingredients that I would actually put into a drink. No weird pre-mixed stuff or juices that are loaded with sugar (I hate when drinks come with optional mixes that you have to buy, which means you’re getting even more sugar). This is just good, clean stuff. Or at least that’s what I tell myself.

I have a rule about maximum drinks per weekend. I know the weather is getting warmer and the more fun we have, the more drinks we’ll end up having. And to be honest, I’m not super into being super drunk. It’s funny how people change. I used to really like to drink. I’d say I “grew out of it” but to be honest, I really haven’t. Just drink less. At least in the summer. Because let’s be honest, it’s still pretty cold in the winter.

But during the summer months, I try to have a maximum drinks per weekend of 4. I know that’s a really low number, but I prefer to just have a few drinks here and there, rather than be super drunk for a few days. I’m all about just a few good drinks, rather than getting wasted.
