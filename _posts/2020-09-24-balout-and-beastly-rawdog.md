BALOU (Balout)

Balout was a dimwitted and clumsy bunny. He was slightly less intelligent than the walking plant that was his best friend, Groot. He was generally perceived as a complete idiot. Balout was very nice and caring but had a hard time expressing himself. He would never defy anyone, even those who were clearly in the wrong. He had a lot of patience, but when he did lose it, he exploded violently and destroyed everything in his path. He also had a habit of falling asleep at any given time, on any given place. Despite this, he was like the Hulk in that when he was enraged, he was a unstoppable force. He changed when around a pretty lady, thereby making him more devoted and understanding.

BEASTLY (Rawdog)

Beastly was also dimwitted. He was always in Baloutâ€™s shadow. He was very caring and wanted nothing but the best for Balout. He was more of a follower than an independent character. He always wanted to help and would do anything for his friend, even if it meant hurting himself. He was not fierce and would rather stay out of a fight. He was very loyal and could strongly blush whenever in the presence of a lady.
