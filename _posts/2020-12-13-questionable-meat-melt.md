I know that you’re probably thinking to yourself, “What in the world is a questionable meat melt?” I’m here to tell you, it’s the best way to eat leftover ham, turkey or chicken.

Last year at Christmas we had a ridiculous amount of leftover ham. I mean, I could have fed an army with the amount of ham we had. I decided to make individual sandwiches out of the leftovers and called it a question mark because we were unsure of what we were eating.

I’m a big fan of toasted sandwiches. It’s really all I ever want for lunch. And I’m a big fan of the classic grilled cheese. And basically any sandwich you can think of. But the grilled cheese sandwich has been done.

So, I was thinking, “How can I make this different?” And I thought to myself, “How about I toast it?” And I have to say it was fantastic. The sandwich was toasted to perfection. It was a little crunchier and a little more caramelized. It was like a grilled cheese plus. They were crunchy on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside.

So I decided I had to share it with you because, well, I was absolutely in love with it. And it’s such a great way to use up those leftovers. Not to mention it’s so easy.

Just toast a piece of bread or a muffin, layer it with a piece of cheese and some leftover meat, top it with another slice of bread and pop it in the toaster oven. Mmmmm. Yum!
