I’ve been working in the food industry for just short of 9 years now. I started as a server while in high school and quickly grew a passion for baking. Being in the kitchen started to make my knees weak and I knew that’s where I belonged.

In fact, I’m pretty sure I’ve always known. I remember when I was little, I used to help make my mom’s “famous” chocolate chip cookies. I’d mix the dough with my father in the kitchen. I loved the smell, I loved being part of the process, and I knew one day I’d want to do that full time.

Fast forward to 9 years later and I still love it just as much as I did back then. I love being in the middle of the process, working with others, creating stuff, and seeing the final results. It’s so much fun, and really brings me joy.

I’ve worked for some great eateries and restaurants. I’ve worked for large companies and small. And I have a to admit, I’ve always looked for a job that was worth it. Meaning, if I’m working 50 hours a week or more, is it really worth it?

I’m sure you’ve heard of the saying, “If you love what you do, you’ll never work a day in your life”? Well, it’s true. I’ve NEVER had a job that I’ve ever dreaded. And I can thank my husband for that. He works long hours too, which means we balance each other out. We’re usually pretty honest with each other. We talk about everything, including our jobs. And he’s always been my rock when it comes to knowing if a job is worth it.

And so I wanted to share with you three ways you can determine if a job is worth it for you.

First, ask yourself why you’re working. If you’re single, with no kids, and you’re working because you want to have a little extra to save for a down payment on a house or maybe you want a vacation, then you may be working for the wrong reasons. If you’re working just to work, and not for the joy of your job, then it may not be worth it
