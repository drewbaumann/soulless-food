So I’ve been doing this whole blog thing for almost 7 years now, and I’ve shared hundreds of recipes. I bet if you really sit down and think about it, you’d find that you’ve made most of them. There are a few recipes that have seriously rocked my world though. This recipe for Paprika Crusader Pork is one of them.

This meal is not a new recipe, but it’s a new twist on an old classic. I feel like it’s the perfect example of how you can take an old recipe and totally make it your own. I first made this pork when I was still in the corporate world (you can check out that post with the original recipe here) and I’ve been making it all the time ever since.

I have to admit that it hasn’t been on the menu much lately because I sometimes find myself in a cooking rut and fall back to recipes I know I know well. But if I’m being honest, my worry that I was in a rut didn’t last long because I came up with this idea for a sweet and spicy version of my Paprika Crusader Pork. This meal is pure genius I tell you.

I added a bit more kick to this version, which I love. It’s all the best flavors of the original and then some. It was a stroke of genius that I hope you try. And that you love. And if you love it as much as I do, I’d love for you to leave a review on the recipe, so others can be inspired to try it too.

Names: Cake Batter Ice Cream

I have to share this recipe because Cake Batter Ice Cream is really, really good. So good, that it’s a bit dangerous.

When Ben and I first started dating, we were pretty much inseparable. We wanted to be together all the time, and we called each other every night after work. My carpooler and I used to joke that it was like junior year of high school all over again.

One night in particular, we were talking and talking and talking, and I was working on our Carrot Cake Cupcakes for another blog post, and then it hit me – Carrot Cake Ice Cream! So I ran to the kitchen and threw together a quick batch of cake batter ice cream and Ben and I ate the whole bowlful
