If you follow me on Instagram, you know that last week I was in the kitchen creating a batch of smut. For those of you not familiar with the term, corn smut is Ukrainian farmers’ slang for a wild mushroom known as fusarium. It’s related to a type of mushroom called truffles, but fusarium is actually toxic. That’s why when you hear the term it’s cooked with the rest of the corn.

So why on earth would I make something so dangerous to eat? Well, the older generation of Ukrainian farmers used to eat it, but now my Mom and probably other people in my Mom’s age-group snack on it. It is delicious, especially if you’re used to eating it. My mother in law made it last year and it was divine. However, I didn’t have any luck with it this year. My fusarium was completely infested with maggots. I can’t eat that stuff.

So I was down for the count. I figured I’d have to wait until next year to try it again. Well, I’ll tell you what they say about the second time around, because this batch of corn smut was terrific. My Mom was over the moon for it. I can’t wait to make it again next year!

There’s a couple of things you have to know when cooking smut. The first is that it has to be completely cleaned off the cob. That’s why it’s easiest to find it in the farmer’s markets in the fall when nothing else is growing. The other thing is that it’s okay to eat it on the cob because the corn and the corn smut fight to share the nutrients from the plant. The corn smut doesn’t get the nutrients it needs to flourish if you remove the corn. So get over it and just enjoy.

This is basically a corn smut omelette served with a little bit of sour cream, pepper and butter. It’s savory and earthy. It’s not for everyone, but if you’re adventurous and want to try something new, I think you’ll love it!
