So I’m not sure if you’ve noticed, but I’ve been on a “brownie” roll lately. And that’s because brownies are really, really, really good. But there’s another reason for that: because they’re one of those foods that hits just the right spot at the end of a long day.

I’m not always in the mood for brownies, but there are times when they are just prefect. And those times that I feel like brownies, I can’t stop myself from making them. That’s how good they can be. But beyond that, I’ll never be mad at a brownie.

And the truth is that I’m really into experimenting with brownies. I’ve made a million different versions of brownies, from Snickerdoodle to Caramel Apple Spice to White Chocolate Chip Macadamia Nut. But here’s the thing: I’ve never made a brownie that’s thick and fudgy. I’ve never made a brownie that’s dense and thick in the middle.

And you know what? I think a brownie like that is needed in this world. Because sometimes the right brownie is what you need, and if you want it to be fudgy, then you need to have one that can hold up to that moniker.

So these brownies? They’re just that. They’re dense, fudgy, and incredibly good. The perfect brownie for those days when you’re feeling like you need one. I know I’m not the only one who has those days. I’m betting many of you out there do too. So on those days, give these brownies a shot. You won’t regret it.
